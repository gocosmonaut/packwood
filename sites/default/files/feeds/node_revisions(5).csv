"41","41","1","Revisiting Rules and Regulations in All-age Communities:   Unenforceable Rules Trumped by Familial Status Rights","<p><strong>By Terry R. Dowdall, Esq.</strong></p><p>The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 created a new protected class of ""familial status.""  In California, the federal courts have addressed these requirements by ruling that ""all age"" communities may not discriminate against children, no more than management can discriminate against any other protected class.  This article is addressed to the need for continuing concerns over rule and regulation content and enforcement.  This guidance comes from a case brought against Plaza Mobile Estates, defended by this office.</p><h2><strong>The FHAA</strong></h2><p>In 1988, Congress amended the Fair Housing Act (FHA) to prohibit not just discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, or national origin, but also included familial status discrimination.  Familial status is defined as "" one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with ... a parent or another person having legal custody of such individual  or individuals.""</p><p>Among other provisions, it is unlawful:</p><p><em>""To discriminate against any persons in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of ... familial status ...""</em></p><p>Thus, a restriction on access or use of common facilities and amenities bases on age of a child (familial status) is a violation of the FHAA, absent compelling business necessity.  Any such rule must be proved to be the least restrictive means to achieving a health and safety justification.  What does this legalese mean to the community owner in practical terms?  A full-blown trial, risks of heavy penalties, damages, and attorney's fees and costs.  This is because there is no bright line test for any age-restrictive regulation:  the law is bereft of any standards or guidance to make a reasonable, predictable risk-assessment or likelihood of success.  Each case depends on the facts and surrounding circumstances.  In other words, each case is a test-case.  In sum, the penalties are so severe that prudent counsel would admonish all to eliminate age-restrictive rules and regulations.</p><p>Children are as protected as any other protected class.  Thus, a simple way to test a rule for FHA compliance is this: insert any other protected class in the place of ""children"" when testing a rule and regulation.  For example, a common past rule (and no longer a valid one) is ""all children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult resident when in the pool area.""  Then, how does this sound:  ""All Methodists must be accompanied by an adult resident ....""  Obviously, such a rule is patently violative of the FHA.</p><p>It is also a violation of the FHAA to express to agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, or renters a preference, (e.g. ""... gosh, if I had my druthers, I would rather not rent to families"").  Another issue is use of selective advertisements, or denying information about housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market because of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or</p><p>national origin, (example, in an area overwhelmingly populated by non-English speakers, advertising only in English language publications).  Other violations will be found where there are ads or statements made regarding applicants, including: ""mature person;"" stating an aversion to ""families with children"" or ""teenagers in the building;"" advertisements stating non more than ""one child;"" or, stating that the community owner does not ""rent to children.""  Posting ""Adult Community: at the entrance to a non-exempt community also violates the FHAA.  Use of the word ""adult"" without more, constitutes a violation of the FHAA.  There are no such thins as adult manufactured home communities, and use of the phrase is deemed to chill family applicants from applying for tenancy in them.</p><p><em>The various rules cited by the courts as impermissibly restricting access or denying the use of the communities' facilities and/or areas on the basis of age, included the following.  If your rules contain any of the following restrictions, or any rules similar to them, it is <strong>strongly advised</strong> that a legal advisor conversant with the FHAA (and implanting regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations) be promptly consulted.</em></p><ul><li>Children under the age of fourteen      (14) years old shall not be allowed to ride a bicycle on the community      streets without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the      manufactured home in which they reside;</li><li>Children under the age of eight      (8) years old must be confined to a play area in the rear fenced yard of      the family residence;</li><li>Children shall not be allowed to      play on community streets, or in any other common are areas; Residents under the age of      eighteen (18) years old shall not be permitted to use the recreation      building (clubhouse) or any other recreational facilities without the      accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which      they reside;</li><li>Residents under the age of      eighteen (18) years old must be accompanied by the registered resident      adult from the same household in order to use any of the recreational      facilities or recreational building (clubhouse);</li><li>Residents and visitors under the age      of eighteen (18) years old may use the swimming pool and sun deck during      the hours of 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. (noon) every day.  Residents and visitors under the age of      eighteen (18) years old are not permitted around the pool or sun deck      after 12 noon;Residents and visitors under the      age of eighteen (18) years old are not permitted to use the saunas or      therapeutic jet pool at any time;</li><li>Children under the age of fourteen      (14) years old must be accompanied by a registered resident adult to be      allowed to ride a bicycle in the community streets;The adult resident host must      accompany all guests of their manufactured home who use the recreation      building (clubhouse) or any of the recreational facilities of the      community;</li><li>Children under the age of fourteen      (14) years old must be accompanied by the registered resident adult from      the same household in order to use any of the recreational facilities or      recreational building (clubhouse);</li><li>When using the clubhouse, persons      under ten (10) years old must be accompanied by an adult resident;</li><li>Use of the billiards room was      restricted to residents over eighteen (18) years old;</li><li>Use of the spa was prohibited to      children under eighteen (18) years old;</li><li>Use of the pool by children      fourteen (14) years old and under required accompaniment by a resident;</li><li>Bicycle riding by anyone is      prohibited unless accompanied by adult resident parent or adult host;</li><li>Parent or resident child or      resident host must accompany children at all times in the pool or pool      area.</li><li>Guests and residents under the age      of eighteen (18) years old are permitted to use the swimming pool and sun      deck from the hours of 9 a.m. to 12 noon only and must be accompanied by      the parent or resident child or resident host;</li><li>No one under the age of eighteen      (18) years old is permitted in the billiard room at any time;</li><li>No one under the age of fourteen      (14) years old is allowed to use the Jacuzzi;</li><li>At 2 p.m. children are to be out      of the pool area;</li><li>Children are not to walk around      the community without adult supervision;</li><li>Minors under sixteen (16) years      old are not permitted in the therapeutic pool;</li><li>For safety, children are not to      ride bicycles, roller skate, skateboard, play in the street, play in RV      storage, plan in car wash or wander around the community;</li><li>Children under with (8) years old shall      be confided to a play area in the rear fenced yard of the family      residence.</li></ul><p>The court held that these rules were not based on compelling business necessity and did not represent the least restrictive intrusions on familial status rights in promoting a health and safety interest.  Having held that these rules were unlawful, the issues remaining for trial in the Plaza Mobile Estates case included damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs for the private plaintiffs.</p><p>While the action had been brought as a class claim (in which all of possibly thousands of affected residents could have been included in damages awards), class certification efforts were defeated, allowing only the named parties to seek damages.</p><p>The court's comments regarding the invalidation of these rules is telling and troubling.  The court stated the age-restrictive rules were facially discriminatory.  In other words, no matter how administered, the rules were invalid as drafted.  Even if never enforced , such rules might dissuade a prospective applicant from applying for tenancy.  These rules ""...treat children, and thus, families with children differently and less favorably than adults-only households.""  ""Describ[ing] parks as 'adult' parks are clear examples of illegal steering.  Although they are not outright refusals to sell or rent or families with children, they indicate a preference for adults only and certainly discourage families with children from applying.""</p><p>Considering the various age restrictive rules, they fall into three categories: (1) absolute prohibitions, (2) adult supervision requirements, and (3) hours of access restrictions.</p><h2><strong>Absolute prohibitions</strong></h2><p>The absolute prohibitions include those rules that (1) prohibit all children under 18 (or 21) years old from using the billiard room and from riding bicycles, (2) prohibit all children under 16 (or 18) years old from using the therapeutic pool, (3) prohibit all children under 14 (or 18) years old from using the sauna or Jacuzzi, (4) require all children under 8 years old to be confined to rear fenced yard of family residence, and (5) prohibit all children from playing on community streets and any other common areas.</p><p>The court held that absolute prohibitions such as the foregoing are illegal.  The regulations are not the least restrictive means to achieve health and safety objectives (""...prohibiting all 'children' from playing in common areas ... cannot be justified"").  The same applies with the billiard room (""... it is unclear how a 17-year-old's access to a billiard room is any more hazardous to ... health or safety that a 22-year-old's access"").</p><h2><strong>Supervision restrictions</strong></h2><p>The fundamental premise adopted by the court is that ""[A]ny concerns that defendants may have are not necessarily linked to age, and any concerns about problem behavior can be address with the use of rules.""  Thus, the court invalidated blanket prohibitions of all 15-year-olds from using the therapeutic pool and all 13-year-olds from using the sauna or Jacuzzi</p><p>In certain instances adult supervision might less restrictively advance health and safety concerns (""assuming arguendo that defendants' concerns were more logically linked to the age restrictions, requiring adult supervision rather than imposing an absolute ban is clearly a less restrictive means ..."").  But where to set the limit is uncertain.  California regulations state:</p><p>""Where no lifeguard service is provided, a warning sign shall be placed in plain view and shall state 'Warning – No Lifeguard on Duty' with clearly legible letters at least 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) high.  In addition, the sign shall also state 'Children Under the Age of 14 Should not Use Pool Without an Adult in Attendance.""</p><p>Based on the Plaza Mobile Estates decision, it is needlessly legally risky to impose any supervision requirement.  Clearly, a 14 year age limit for an adult supervision is not enforceable, not legal, and constitutes a violation of the FHA, despite former administrative decisions suggesting the contrary and California regulations cited above.  Yet, the need for an age limit is strikingly clear.  The same rule applies to use of spas and whirlpools.  Certainly an adult supervision requirement should be reasonable[1], but eh court has ruled that such concerns are fro the parents, not the management.</p><h2><strong>A few apparently unassailable precepts</strong></h2><p>Given that this case raises many more questions than it answers, the ability to promulgate and rely on age-restrictive rules for access and supervision are certainly less than a matter of clarity.  While the previous rulings concerning the enforceability of age-restrictive rules are in some doubt, a few precepts can be stated with some reliability.  The first is that an outright prohibition of use or access to any facility or amenity cannot be allowed.  Setting up selected hours for usage of a facility of amenity cannot be allowed.  Less certain is the ability to promulgate rules requiring adult supervision of children of varying ages for use of facilities or amenities.  It would appear that no supervision can be mandated for areas such as clubhouse, billiard room, library or common areas.</p><h2><strong>Establishing minimum age requirements for supervision:  A foray into the uncertain</strong></h2><p>The ""14 and under"" requirement of California regulations for pool supervision is a should not a must provision.  Hence, management cannot require supervision of 14 years of age and under.  The only clearly legal position is not to require supervision, and let it be for the parents to take personal accountability and responsibility for their children.  The court makes this statement:</p><p>""... there is nothing magical about the age 18 or 14 years old if defendants' concerns are for the protection of the health and safety of the children or other residents in using recreational facilities or the swimming pool or riding bicycles.  Such concerns could be addressed with the use of rules.  Moreover, rather than being connected to such ages, bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement.""</p><p>The courts have intervened on occasion to require discrimination against children for their own good and government does so all the time.  For example, you cannot vote until you are 18, drink alcohol until you are 21, cannot drive until you are 16.[2]  However, housing providers subject to the FHA may not rely on or use the same governmentally-established restrictions in developing their rules and regulations despite the dangers posed by the common area facilities.</p><p>Another example:  Pedestrian injuries are the second greatest cause of harm to children from five to 14 years of age.  See the National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997.[3]  However, it is illegal to have a rule and regulations which states that ""children are not to walk around the community without adult supervision.""</p><p>Is it unreasonable to require adult supervision within the common areas of a manufactured home community?  It would seem that such a rule is reasonable.  However, for a community owner, such a rule violates the FHA.  On the other hand the Consumer Products safety Commission urges supervision of children while on a playground for example (Consumer Product Safety Commission, Public Playground Safety Checklist, CPSC Document #327: ""10. Carefully supervised children on playgrounds to make sure they're safe"").  The federal law states that the parents are responsible for their children, not the management.</p><h2><strong>Previously sustained rules</strong></h2><p>The courts have previously allowed the following rules.  This information may be largely historical at this juncture, for it remains unclear whether or not they remain viable in light of the Plaza Mobile Estates decision (these rules were sustained under the previous ""reasonableness"" test, not the ""compelling interest"" basis test):</p><ol><li>Rules which bar use of a pool for      children fourteen (14) years of age and less have been upheld because the      prohibition implements legislative policy.       HUD v. Paradise Gardens, HUDALJ 04-90-0321-1, 1992 WL 406531      (HUDALJ Oct. 15, 1992)</li><li>A rule which required children      under the age of fifteen (15) years to be accompanied by an adult who is      at least eighteen (18) years old when using the swimming pool and exercise      equipment.  (HUD vs. Trace      Corporation 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).</li><li>Rules have been sustained for age      restricted access as to power tools.       ""...Respondents may keep the machine shop with industrial power tools      accessible only to tenants who are at least fifteen (15) years of age and      may require tenant children between the ages of fifteen (15) and eighteen      (18) years to be accompanied by an adult who is at least eighteen (18)      years old when using the machine shop.       Further, Respondent may require all users of the machine shop to      hve complete training on the proper use of such tools."" (HUD vs. Trace      Corporation, 1995 WL 434221 (H.U.D.A.L.J.)(Consent decree)).]\</li><li>In the unpublished decision of      United States v. Town Hall Terrace Association, 1997 WL 128353 (W.D.N.Y.      1997), the housing provider made available four pieces of exercise      equipment: a multi-purpose with lifting machine, a stationary bicycle, an      inclining board and a rowing machine – in its ""the fitness center.""  Until 1992 an express policy restricted      the use of the fitness center and its equipment to persons at least      eighteen (18) years old.  After      mid-1992, this threshold was lowered to sixteen (16).[4]</li><li>One case allowed for a rule      requiring adult supervision of children six (6) and under while biking in      a street.  U.S. v. M. Westland Co.,      CV 93-4141, Fair Housing-Fair Lending 15,941 (HUD ALJ 1994)).  Another authority states that no child      should be permitted in a street on a bicycle until at least ten (10) years      of age.  (""Cycling should be      restricted to sidewalks and paths until a child is age 10 and able to show      how well he or she rides and observes the basic rules of the road.  Parental and adult supervision is      essential and until the traffic skills and judgment thresholds are reached      by each child.""  The National Safe      Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997).</li></ol><p>But under the more recent Plaza Mobile Estates decision, the past allowances provide no basis on which to write your rules and regulations.</p><h2><strong>Don't blame the court!</strong></h2><p>However, it is too much to criticize or impugn the court for adhering to the letter of the law, and not legislating by ""judicial fiat.""  The court interprets what the law is and does not legislate.  That is the job of Congress and more pointedly in this case HUD (in its rule-making powers).  The FHA prohibits discrimination, period.  The federal law makes NO exceptions; exceptions to familial status rights is the job of HUD.  It is not the court's duty.  The court is not the Legislature.</p><h2><strong>The need for uniform guidelines to inform the housing providers of permissible restrictions</strong></h2><p>HUD should provide guidance for housing providers and establish bright line tests for common sense age-restrictive rules.  HUD should defer to other legislative judgments made for child protection by allowing community owners to replicate existing laws in their rules and regulations.  Model regulations for protection of the young could be published.  HUD could establish a rule pre-approval procedure.</p><p>Community owners just want to comply with the law and provide reasonable requirements for protection of children.  But now, even experienced lawyers cannot intelligibly predict the enforceability of any age-restrictive rules.  At this time, attaining any ascribed legitimacy of a rule only follows after an expensive legal defense with a heavy burden of proof requiring compelling business necessity.  A conciliation agreement binds the complainant.  If another resident complains the next day, the conciliation agreement is worthless as a defense to the rule.  This is an inconceivably inefficient manner of testing rule validity.  The costs to business in such concerns vastly outweigh the benefit to be achieved.  The cost to the consumer in spreading the expense of this exercise could be largely obviated if the housing provider had some guidance in defining acceptable rules for promotion of health and safety.  The suggestion of administering proficiency tests is a null and void concept.  The liability for negligently administering such tests, seeking and paying for qualified testers, and then excluding the non-proficient residents will not be pursued by a single housing provider.</p><p>What can we do?  Even in the absence of specific rules, educational materials may help parents understand common risks associated with youth.  When educational information is provided as an adjunct to an activity rather than a rule restricting an activity, the chance of a claim of discriminatory preference is less likely to be made.  For example, when a community owner offers such educational material from organizations who seek better protection of children, (e.g., police departments, charitable organizations, etc.) the community owner is providing a service – disseminating information and facts – not discriminating against children.[5]</p><p>You may also consider consulting with HUD in advance of amending rules and regulations.  IF HUD even informally opines that a proposed policy is not defensible, or that no comment can be offered, at least the community owner can better assess the risk faced with a new rule and regulation.  For example, if a resident complains that a particular resident who has open sores due to infection with the AIDS virus desires to use the swimming pool, can the management require that resident to stay out of the pool?</p><p>When faced with the question, the manger called to advise that she was not sure how to proceed.  While administrative regulations require a doctor's letter stating that no public health or safety risk was posed by the patient's use of the pool, I consulted with HUD before announcing the management policy.</p><h2><strong>Finally</strong></h2><p>All the community owner wants is to know what the law is!  What we do know is certain rules, certain practices reflecting what the law is not.  But it is grossly unfair to relegate the duty to set standards on management.  Having read this article, can you now, safely amend your rules to impose such a rule?  No.  No attorney can give an absolute assurance that such a rule will be sustained until ruled valid in a court.  Until a court actually rules on the validity of the rule, or HUD or DFEH offers guidance on their interpretation of the rule, there can be no assurance of what an will not be permitted in developing age-restrictive rules and regulations.  The best policy is to eliminate any and all age restrictive rules and regulations to avoid FHA claims.</p><p><strong>Reprinted with permission from Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association (WMA) ""Reporter"", June 2008.</strong></p><p>Terry Dowdall has specialized in manufactured home communities' law since 1978.

Since 1980, CPSC has reports of more than 700 deaths in spas and hot tubs.  About one-third of those were drownings to children under age five.  Consumers should keep a locked safety cover on the spa whenever it is not in use and keep children away unless there is constant adult supervision.  Hot Tub Temperatures – CPSC knows of several deaths from extremely hot water (approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit) in a spa.  High temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness, resulting in drowning.  In addition, raised body temperature can lead to heat stroke and death.  In 1987, CPSC helped develop requirements for temperature controls to make sure that spa water temperatures never exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit.  Pregnant women and young children should not use a spa before consulting with a physician. ... ""CPSC Document #5112 ""Spas, Hot Tubs, and Whirlpools Safety Alert"".</p><p>[2] Municipal curfew regulations abound which restrict children.  Los Angeles is typical.  No one under 18 years of age is permitted in public places during school hours ("" ... present in or upon the public streets, ... or any place open to the public during the hours of 8:30 am and 1:30 pm"").  L.A.M.C. 45.04.  The same restrictions apply after 10 pm.  (""... any minor under the age of eighteen years to be present in or upon any public street, ... between the hours of 10:00 pm on any day and sunrise of the immediately following day; ....""). L.A.M.C. 45.03.  Regulations for pool halls E.g. 17 (Midland Mi. Mun. Code Sec. 15-34) and 18 (1063-B.  Pool halls.

It is unsafe for a park owner to rely on local or state laws in this respect in drafting rules and regulations.</p><p>[3] ""[P]edestrian injury is the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death among children ages 5 to 14.  While the majority of pedestrian deaths and injuries are traffic-related, children ages 0 to 2 are more likely to suffer non-traffic-related pedestrian injuries, including those occurring in driveways, parking lots or on sidewalks.  Although pedestrian injuries are not as common as motor vehicle occupant injuries, a disproportionate number of the injuries sustained by child pedestrians are severe.  Between 25 and 50 percent of child pedestrian injuries require hospital admission.  Children ages 5 to 9 are at the greatest risk from traffic–related pedestrian death and injury.  Nearly one-third of all children ages 5 to 9 who are killed in traffic crashes are pedestrians"").</p><p>[4] According to the U.S. Products Safety Commission: ""The U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that between 1985 and 1989, the latest period for which data are available, there were 1,200 amputations of children's fingers because of contact with exercise bikes.  Most children were under the age of five.  Many of the injuries occurred when the child's fingers touched the moving bike wheel or the chain and sprocket assembly.  The Commission is concerned about the severity of injuries to children, especially because the hazard may not be obvious.  Therefore, the commission warns parents always to keep children away from exercise bikes.  Never use a bike without a chain guard, and when not using the bike, store it where children cannot get to it.  Children's fingers can be amputated if they touch moving parts of exercise bike.""

<p>B.	By LANDLORD. LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(1)	TENANT or others occupying TENANT'S RV violate a law or ordinance which relates to TENANT’S conduct as a tenant or violates this Agreement or the Community Rules and Regulations.  In such case, if this is a month-to month tenancy, and TENANT has occupied the Premise for one year or less, LANDLORD may terminate TENANT’S tenancy without cause by giving not less than thirty (30) days’ advance written notice.  Provided, however, if TENANT has occupied the Premises for over one year, the no-cause advance written notice of termination may not be less than sixty (60) days.  LANDLORD may give a 30-day written notice of termination or such shorter period as allowed by law if the violation is a separate and distinct act or omission and is not ongoing.  If the violation is capable of being cured, TENANT may avoid termination by correcting the specified violation within 14 days or such other time provided in the notice from LANDLORD describing the violation.  If substantially the same violation reoccurs within 6 months, LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy by giving TENANT a non-curable 10-day written notice.  If this is a week-to-week tenancy, the 30-day period above is reduced to 7 days; the 14 day period above is reduced to 4 days, and the 10 day period above is reduced to 4 days.</p>
<p>(2)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy by giving 72 hours' written notice of nonpayment if TENANT fails to pay rent within 7 days after the first day rent becomes due, or 144 hours written notice of nonpayment if TENANT fails to pay rent within 4 days after the first day the rent becomes due.</p>
<p>(3)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy after 24 hours’ written notice specifying the cause if, among other reasons, (a) the TENANT, someone in the TENANT'S control or the TENANT'S pet seriously threatens to inflict substantial personal injury, or inflicts any substantial personal injury, upon a person on the premises other than the TENANT; (b) The TENANT or someone in the TENANT'S control recklessly endangers a person on the premises other than the TENANT by creating a serious risk of substantial personal injury; (c) The TENANT, someone in the TENANT'S control or the TENANT'S pet inflicts any substantial personal injury upon a neighbor living in the immediate vicinity of the premises; (d)  The TENANT or someone in the TENANT'S control intentionally inflicts any substantial damage to the premises or the TENANT'S pet inflicts substantial damage to the premises on more than one occasion; (e)(A) The TENANT intentionally provided substantial false information on the application for the tenancy within the past year; (B) The false information was with regard to a criminal conviction of the TENANT that would have been material to the LANDLORD'S acceptance of the application; and (C) The LANDLORD terminates the rental agreement within 30 days after discovering the falsity of the information; (f) The TENANT has vacated the premises, the person in possession is holding contrary to a written rental agreement that prohibits subleasing the premises to another or allowing another person to occupy the premises without the written permission of the LANDLORD, and the LANDLORD has not knowingly accepted rent from the person in possession; or (g)  The TENANT, someone in the TENANT'S control or the TENANT'S pet commits any act that is outrageous in the extreme, on the premises or in the immediate vicinity of the premises.</p>
<p>(4)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy prior to expiration of and fixed term if this is a lease as identified in Section 3 above, if the facility or a portion of it that includes the Space is to be closed.</p>
<p>(5)	LANDLORD has the absolute right to terminate this tenancy without cause unless this is a fixed term lease as identified in Section 3 above, in which case, absent a breach of the terms hereof, it will terminate automatically, with no further notice, at midnight of the last day of the lease term.  If this is a month-to-month tenancy, this Agreement may be terminated by not less than 30 days’ advance written notice.  If this is a week-to-week tenancy, it may be terminated by not less than 10 days’ advance written notice. (</p>
<p>6)	The preceding paragraphs (1)-(5) are not intended to limit LANDLORD’S right to terminate this tenancy for any other reasons as allowed by state, federal or local laws, now existing or hereinafter enacted.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">14.	SERVICE OF NOTICES</span></strong></p>
<p>Where written notice between LANDLORD and TENANT is required or permitted by this Agreement or Oregon Laws, it shall be by (a) personal delivery; (b) first class mail; or (c) both first class mail and attachment of a copy at a designated location.  In the case of notice to TENANT, the attachment shall be at the main entrance of TENANT’S RV.  In the case of notice to LANDLORD, the attachment shall be at the address of the manager identified in Paragraph 4, above.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>15.	INDEMNIFICATION BY TENANT</strong></span></p>
<p>Tenant shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend LANDLORD from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, liability and expense, including, but not limited to, attorney and other professional fees in connection with the loss of life, personal injury and/or damage to property arising from the occupancy or use by TENANT, or those persons occupying the Space or any part thereof, caused wholly or in part by any act or omission of the TENANT, TENANT’S family, TENANT’S pets, visitors, guests or invitees.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>16.	SEVERANCE CLAUSE</strong></span></p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement or any document incorporated into this Agreement is ruled invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected and each other term and provision shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Oregon Laws.  The parties agree that should a court rule that a provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, that ruling shall not be placed into evidence to any jury empanelled to hear any other dispute between LANDLORD and TENANT.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>17.	WAIVER</strong></span></p>
<p>LANDLORD’S failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement or the rules and regulations shall not be deemed a waiver of LANDLORD’S right to do so on future occasions.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>18.	ATTORNEY FEES, COSTS, DISBURSEMENTS</strong></span></p>
<p>In the event of suit, action or arbitration instituted to enforce or interpret any provision of this Agreement, the losing party shall pay the prevailing party's reasonable attorney fees upon trial or arbitration and/or appeal therefrom, together with all costs and disbursements.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>19.	INSPECTION</strong></span></p>
<p>By signing this Agreement, TENANT agrees that TENANT has carefully inspected the Community and Space, and has found them to be acceptable and in the condition as represented by LANDLORD.  To the extent permitted by Oregon law, TENANT accepts the condition of the Community and Space, in its present condition at the commencement of the tenancy, with all defects, apparent or not apparent.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>20.	CONDEMNATION</strong></span></p>
<p>LANDLORD shall be exclusively entitled to any payment or award for the taking of any portion of the Community under the power of eminent domain, except that TENANT will be entitled to any payment or award attributable solely to the loss or damage to TENANT’S RV or other personal property owned by TENANT.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>21.	MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENT AND RULES</strong></span></p>
<p>Modification of Agreement.  This Agreement represents the final understanding between the parties and may not be modified or amended, except in writing, signed by both LANDLORD and TENANT.  Notwithstanding the preceding, LANDLORD shall have the right, subject only to any applicable advance notice imposed by this Agreement or Oregon law, to unilaterally amend this Agreement or the Community Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>22.  APPLICABLE RECREATIONAL VEHICLE LAWS</strong></span></p>
<p>A.	This Agreement shall be subject to all applicable state and federal RV laws, ordinances, and regulations, except as may be permitted to be modified by this Agreement.</p>
<p>B.	An accessory building or structure paid for or provided by TENANT belongs to TENANT and is subject to a demand by LANDLORD that it be removed upon termination of the tenancy.</p>
<p>C.	This RV must be: (a) Located in a manufactured dwelling park, mobile home park or recreational vehicle park as defined by Oregon law; (b) Occupied as a residential dwelling; and (c) Lawfully connected to water and electrical supply systems and a sewage disposal system.  If (a), (b) and (c) exist in this tenancy, a state agency or local government may not, solely on the grounds that this is a recreational vehicle occupancy, prohibit the placement or occupancy of the RV or impose any limit on the length of occupancy.  The preceding does not limit the authority of a state agency or local government to impose other special conditions on the placement or occupancy of the RV if the tenancy is for the occupancy of a recreational vehicle in a manufactured dwelling park, mobile home park or recreational vehicle park.</p>

EVERY  PERSON’S INDIVIDUAL FACTUAL SITUATION IS DIFFERENT, AND THE INFORMATION BELOW SHOULD NOT BE RELIED  UPON TO THE EXCLUSION OF A MORE IN-DEPTH EVALUATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAW.  READERS ARE  ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THEIR OWN ATTORNEY OR OTHER EXPERT IN THIS SPECIALIZED AREA.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>1. What is SAFE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SAFE is the acronym for The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008.   Although it is federal legislation that was enacted in response to the national credit and  mortgage crises, it requires each state to enact regulatory legislation. HUD monitors  compliance, although it does not have legal authority to grant exemptions.  On August 30,  2011, HUD published its Final Rule for SAFE.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HUD is responsible for setting minimum standards for states to following in the licensing of  providers of certain residential mortgage services.  It also has set up the Nationwide Mortgage  Licensing System and Registry (“NMLSR”), which is a national database of all mortgage  companies and mortgage loan originators. Responsibility for oversight falls under the  authority of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank  Act.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>2. What is the purpose of the SAFE Act?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SAFE was designed to increase consumer protection in residential lending.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>3. What activities does SAFE apply to?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It applies to mortgage companies and their mortgage loan originators or “MLOs” acting either  as employees or independent contractors.   An individual is in the business of loan origination  if they, “in a commercial context and habitually or repeatedly” engage in: (1) taking a  residential mortgage loan application; and (2) offering or negotiating the terms of a  residential mortgage loan for compensation or gain; or represent to the public (e.g. through  advertising or other means of communicating) that they will perform these two activities.    The phrase “taking a residential mortgage loan application” means that the MLO receives it  for the purpose of facilitating a credit decision.  The phrase “offering or negotiating” means  that the MLO presents particular lending terms for consideration by a borrower.  It is the  activity - not its label or the title of the person - that determines whether one is a mortgage  loan originator.  The law does not make one a mortgage loan originator if they engage in the  above-described conduct exclusively for public, charitable, or family purposes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In order to obtain a license as an MLO, SAFE requires testing, pre-licensure and continuing  education, criminal background checks and financial responsibility.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>4. What type of transactions does SAFE apply to?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SAFE applies to certain mortgage transactions. A “mortgage transaction” means a credit or  loan transaction that is or will be used by the debtor primarily for personal, family, or  household purposes <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>and</strong></span> is secured by a mortgage or equivalent consensual security interest  on a dwelling or residential real estate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5. Does SAFE apply to the financing of manufactured homes and manufactured  vehicles?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes.  The term ""dwelling"" is cross-referenced to the definition of “dwelling” in section 103(v)  of the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) (15 U.S.C. 1601 note).  Regulation Z, which implements  TILA, defines “dwelling” to mean ""a residential structure that contains 1 to 4 units, whether or  not that structure is attached to real property. Besides attached homes, a dwelling also  includes an individual condominium unit, cooperative unit, mobile home, and trailer, if it is  used as a residence.""  HUD interprets a ""mobile home"" to include a manufactured home, as  defined in the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As to loans secured by manufactured homes treated as personal property under state law  HUD’s final rule states:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>…an individual engaging in the business of a loan originator with respect to a loan  that is to be secured by a manufactured home, mobile home, recreational vehicle, <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>house boat, or trailer that is to be used as a residence is subject to licensing under the  SAFE Act.  Even if a state categorizes loans secured by such residential structures <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>as  chattel mortgages, the SAFE Act covers these loans and such states must ensure that  individuals engaging in the business of a loan originator with respect to these <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>loans  are licensed under the SAFE Act.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6. Does SAFE apply to sellers of manufactured homes if they don’t directly “lend”  purchase money funds, but merely carry back <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>paper, such as a retail installment contract or  note and security interest in the home?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes.  This was specifically addressed in HUD’s Final Rule:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>A ‘‘residential mortgage loan’’ includes an installment sales contract, which the  commenters advise is frequently involved in seller financing. ‘‘Residential mortgage <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>loans,’’ as defined by section 1503(8) of the SAFE Act, refer to typical financing  mechanisms such as mortgages and deeds of trusts.  In addition, the SAFE Act  definition <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>also includes ‘‘other equivalent consensual security interest on a dwelling  (as the term ‘dwelling’ is defined by section 103(v) of TILA) or residential real estate  upon which <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>is constructed or intended to be constructed a dwelling,’’ which has the  potential for including a broad range of other financing mechanisms.  For the  purposes of this rule, <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>‘‘equivalent consensual security interests’’ specifically include  installment sales contracts, consistent with the treatment by many states of such  contracts in the same <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>manner as mortgages and purchase money mortgages offered  by sellers of residential real estate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>7. Who regulates Oregon’s statewide version of SAFE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Oregon’s version of SAFE is found at ORS Chapter 86A.    It is known as the “Oregon Mortgage  Lender Law.”  The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (“DCBS”)  has general supervision and control over all loan originators, mortgage bankers and mortgage  brokers residing in Oregon or doing business in Oregon - even though they do not reside here.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>8. Under Oregon law, who qualifies as a mortgage loan originator, mortgage banker  and mortgage broker?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <strong>loan originator</strong> is defined under Oregon law to mean an individual employed by or acting as  an agent or independent contractor for a mortgage banker or mortgage broker with the  expectation of compensation or gain that is determined by the amount borrowed or the  terms and conditions agreed to by the mortgage loan borrower.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <strong>loan originator</strong> is the individual having the primary job responsibilities, including  negotiating with a potential borrower for the purpose of establishing the terms and  conditions of a mortgage loan.  A loan originator does not include an individual whose  responsibilities are clerical or administrative, such as gathering information, requesting  information, word processing, soliciting general interest in mortgage loans, sending  correspondence and assembling files.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Subject to several exceptions, a <strong>mortgage banker</strong> is one who for compensation or in the  expectation of compensation, directly or indirectly makes, negotiates or offers to make or  negotiate, a mortgage banking loan or a mortgage loan, and services or sells a mortgage  banking loan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The term does not include financial institutions, financial holding companies, bank holding  companies, savings and loan holding companies as defined under state and federal laws. It  also excludes various individuals who make loans secured by an interest in real estate for the  person’s own investment and who is not engaged in the business of making such loans;  Oregon licensed attorneys; real property owners who sell their own property; builders and  contractors who accept repayment on an installment or deferred payment basis and arising  out of labor and materials furnished in the improvement of that real property, and those who  are exercising their statutory lien rights.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <strong>mortgage broker</strong> is one who engages all or part of the time, for the account of others, or for  the person’s own account, in the business of: (1) Selling real estate paper whether as an  issuer, agent or principal; (2) Accepting funds from one or more persons or (3) For  compensation, or the expectation of compensation, directly or indirectly makes, negotiates or  offers to make or negotiate a mortgage loan.     The exemptions found for mortgage bankers, described above, generally exist for mortgage  brokers, and include real estate licensees, if such services are incidental to their professional  real estate activity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>9. If I have a manufactured dealer’s license would I still be subject to SAFE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It appears so. Here is what HUD’s Final Rule and Oregon’s statute provide:    A person with a manufactured structure dealer’s license who provides services  customarily associated with the retail sales of manufactured dwellings (including  communication of generally available information regarding mortgage loans) is  excluded from being a mortgage broker, unless:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(1) The person receives from a purchaser a fee or commission as a mortgage  broker or mortgage banker that is disclosed in the sales contract, purchase agreement  or <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>applicable federal documents;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(2) For the benefit of a potential purchaser, the person completes a loan  application form or other document that is part of a mortgage banking loan and  completes a good <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>faith estimate under the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures  Act (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(3) The person solicits or receives credit information from a prospective  purchaser for the purpose of making credit decisions (Underscore added.); or</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(4) The person negotiates with a potential purchaser the terms of a mortgage  loan including but not limited to points, interest rates, length of loan or other loan  conditions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is this underscored language above that appears to bring you under SAFE, and by  extension, the Oregon law.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>10. Do Mortgage Bankers and Mortgage Brokers have to be licensed in Oregon?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes.  ORS 86A.103  provides that “…it is unlawful for any person to engage in residential  mortgage transactions in this state as a mortgage banker or mortgage broker unless the  person is licensed….”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>11. How does one apply for a Mortgage Banker or Mortgage Broker license?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The law can be found at ORS 86A.106 and rules prescribed by the Director of the Department  of Consumer and Business Services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>12. What does Oregon law provide regarding Mortgage Loan Originators?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following is a brief summary:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• The names of all mortgage loan originators (“MLOs”) employed by mortgage bankers  or brokers must be provided to the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services  (“DCBS”) and kept at least 30 days’ current.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Mortgage bankers and brokers are required to provide the DCBS with satisfactory  evidence (as determined by administrative rule) that each of the people they have hired or  intend to hire have: (1) Successfully completed an entry-level training course approved or  provided by an organization certified by the DCBS director; and (2) Passed an examination.  If  the individual has been employed as a loan originator for two or more years in this state, they  must have completed the required continuing education.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Mortgage loan originators (as well as mortgage bankers and brokers) may not engage  in dishonest, fraudulent or illegal practices or conduct in a business or profession or engage in  unfair or unethical practices or conduct in connection with the mortgage business; Willfully or  repeatedly violate or fail to comply with a provision of the regulatory laws; Fail to account for  money or property received in connection with a mortgage loan; Fail to meet the training,  education or continuing education requirements for mortgage loan originators; Perform an  act as a mortgage loan originator in a negligent or incompetent manner.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>13. What is the cost of licensing/registering with the DCBS?</strong> Here are the latest administrative rules:     Mortgage Bankers or Brokers   In addition to any fees required to participate in the National Mortgage Licensing  System and Registry, a mortgage banker or a mortgage broker shall pay to the  director the following fees at the time of application or renewal:   (1) A nonrefundable application fee for a mortgage banker or mortgage broker  license of $960 plus a $330 nonrefundable application fee for each branch the  mortgage banker or mortgage broker establishes in Oregon.   (2) A nonrefundable renewal application fee for a mortgage banker or mortgage  broker license of $480 plus a $165 nonrefundable renewal application fee for each  branch the mortgage banker or mortgage broker maintains in Oregon.     Mortgage Loan Originators   (1) In addition to any fees required to participate in the National Mortgage  Licensing System and Registry, a person applying for a mortgage loan originator  license shall pay to the director a nonrefundable fee of $80 for the issuance of a  mortgage loan originator license.   (2) In addition to any fees required to participate in the National Mortgage  Licensing System and Registry, a person renewing a mortgage loan originator license  shall pay to the director a nonrefundable fee of $65 for the renewal of a mortgage  loan originator license.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>14. What are the penalties if I fail to comply?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to ORS 86A.130, whenever the Director of the DCBS has “reasonable cause to believe”  that a person has been engaged or is engaging in any violation of Oregon law (including acting as a  mortgage broker, banker or loan originator without a license), the director may bring suit against  the alleged perpetrator.  The court may fine the person not more than $5,000 for each violation.    Each violation is a separate offense. In the case of a continuing violation, each day’s continuance is  a separate violation, but the maximum penalty for any continuing violation is $20,000 for each  offense.  The court may also appoint a receiver (who can be the Director of the DCBS over the  defendant’s assets).  Additionally, the statute allows for attorney fees.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The director may include a claim for restitution or damages on behalf “of the persons  injured” by the unlawful act or practice.  Additionally, the director may bring a claim for  “disgorgement of illegal gains or profits derived.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>15. What are my choices if I am an Oregon park owner and want to rehab and sell  abandoned or pre-abandoned manufactured homes to prospective buyers who will occupy them?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It appears that you have two choices:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(1) Hire as an employee or independent contractor a MLO who will engage in the activities  described for them under state law.  This will require you to become either a mortgage banker  or mortgage broker.  The reason for this is because the MLO is required to work under the  supervision and control of one or the other.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(2) Contract with an existing MLO who is already working for an Oregon licensed mortgage banker  or broker.  Presumably, this would be on an independent contractor basis.       NOTE:  THE ABOVE INFORMATION WILL BE UPDATED AND CLARIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME.

"229","229","3","Limited Dealer License and new Federal Laws on Financing  (SAFE) when Selling an Abandoned Home","<p>Question:  According to MHCO’s recent SAFE Act article authored by Phil Querin (uploaded 12/6/2011, MHCO.ORG ""Community Updates""), a park owner wishing to sell abandoned homes on site may do so with a limited dealer’s license if they either: (a) Are licensed as a mortgage banker or broker; or, (b) Secure the services of a Mortgage Loan Originator (“MLO”).  Where do you find a MLO that can prepare loan documents in the Portland area?  Can their cost be included in the loan or can a loan origination fee be charged for their services.  If so, could MHCO issue a list of MLO's and their charges? What would I have to do to become a licensed MLO for my park?</p>
<p>Answer:  My prior article indicated that park owners holding a limited dealer’s license are subject to regulation under the SAFE Act if they “carry the paper”, i.e. enter into a retail installment contract with the tenant-purchaser.  This is because when they do so, they are making a “credit decision” about their buyer.   Park owners have two choices:</p>
<p>1.	Hire a MLO who will engage in the activities described for them under state law.  This will require the park owner to become either a mortgage banker or mortgage broker.  The reason for this is because the MLO is required to work under the supervision and control of one or the other.</p>
<p>2.	Contract with an existing MLO who is already working for an Oregon licensed mortgage banker or broker.  Presumably, this would be on an independent contractor basis.</p>
<p>The second alternative is likely more attractive in most cases, since it avoids the cost of securing a special license and then becoming an employer, with all of the regulation that this entails.  If you are interested in learning more about becoming a mortgage banker or mortgage broker, you should go the website for the Department of Consumer and Business Services (“DCBS”) here.</p>
<p>This means that your next best solution is to contract with a mortgage banker or broker to secure the services of their MLO on an independent contractor or similar basis.  MLOs are employed by mortgage bankers or brokers – they are not separately licensed as such. This means that you cannot “become” a MLO unless you want to work for a mortgage banker or broker.</p>
<p>MHCO is currently evaluating the idea of a referral list. However, as you imply, the entire lending industry is not without its own liability issues.  Accordingly, the decision to actually publish a referral list – and the implicit “endorsement” risk that comes with doing so – is something we may ultimately decline to do.  In the meantime, we suggest that you contact other MHCO members and Associate members. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the issue of costs, we know of no restrictions on recovery of loan fees and costs that are unique to MLOs.  This is not to say that the sky’s the limit, because you do not want to charge for services not actually performed, or in amounts that are not customary.  If in doubt, you should contact the DCBS at (503) 378-4100.</p>
<p>As for trying to recover the cost of the MLO as a part of the closing cost of the sale, I do not know for sure and suggest you contact the DCBS.  Alternatively, you may wish to consider simply building the cost of the MLO into the resale price of the home.  This would avoid any regulatory issues entirely.</p>
<p>Lastly, I note that your question asks about finding …”a MLO that can prepare loan documents…”  As stated in my prior SAFE article for MHCO, a loan originator is the individual whose primary job responsibilities include negotiating with a potential borrower for the purpose of establishing the terms and conditions of a mortgage loan.  <em>A loan originator does not include an individual whose responsibilities are clerical or administrative, such as gathering information, requesting information, word processing, soliciting general interest in mortgage loans, sending correspondence and assembling files.</em> Accordingly, it is my opinion that the task of “preparing loan documents” is not really something you need to pay the MLO to do.  It is discretionary functions, such as credit evaluation and negotiation of terms, that are reserved to MLOs. The merely administrative tasks can be performed by others, even your own employees or managers.</p>","<p>Question:  According to MHCO’s recent SAFE Act article authored by Phil Querin (uploaded 12/6/2011, MHCO.ORG ""Community Updates""), a park owner wishing to sell abandoned homes on site may do so with a limited dealer’s license if they either: (a) Are licensed as a mortgage banker or broker; or, (b) Secure the services of a Mortgage Loan Originator (“MLO”).  Where do you find a MLO that can prepare loan documents in the Portland area?  Can their cost be included in the loan or can a loan origination fee be charged for their services.",,"1330364691","2"

16.1	These rules and regulations are conditions pursuant to which HOMEOWNERS occupy COMMUNITY.  OWNER may enforce rules and regulations which are conditions of occupancy by terminating the lot rental agreement of the HOMEOWNER who violates a rule or regulation.  As an alternative to terminating a rental agreement, OWNER may impose a monetary fine on a violating HOMEOWNER in accordance with the dispute resolution process set forth in this section.

16.2	If the basis for terminating a rental agreement is within the dispute resolution process set forth in this section, OWNER will follow that process prior to terminating an agreement.

16.3	The dispute resolution process set forth in this section applies to disputes between HOMEOWNER and OWNER about certain of HOMEOWNER’S and OWNER'S obligations under the lot rental agreement and the rules and regulations.  The process is intended to serve as a vehicle for resolution of the minor disputes which commonly arise from time to time between OWNERS and HOMEOWNERS with respect to maintenance of premises, HOMEOWNER conduct which disturbs other HOMEOWNERS, and similar disputes.  The process applies to all disputes arising in connection with the lot rental agreement or these rules and regulations except for the types of disputes specifically excluded.

16.4	The dispute resolution process does not apply to the following disputes:

a)	any matters excluded by law from being a part of the dispute resolution process, including the amount of rent, rent increases, nonpayment of rent, or the closure or sale of COMMUNITY;

b)	charges due or claimed to be due under the lot rental agreement or the rules and regulations, including rent, services charge, assessed fine, landscaping deposit, permit fee, additional occupants or vehicles charge, attorneys' fees, late charge, bad check fee, or interest, or the adjustment, computation or modification of these charges;

c)	matters which are issues necessary to the resolution of disputes which are not subject to this dispute resolution process and are in litigation (i.e., whether proper notice was given, whether a party is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees, or the like);

d)	any claim for damages (which is otherwise subject to the process) where damages are reasonably anticipated to exceed $2000.00;

e)	any lien claim;

f)		termination of tenancy once written notice of termination has been given by OWNER, whether or not that notice has been received by HOMEOWNER;

g)	term of the lot rental agreement and renewal of the lease term;

h)	sale of its manufactured home by HOMEOWNER and OWNER'S acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a HOMEOWNER;

I)	disputes which involve a HOMEOWNER whose tenancy has been terminated by OWNER;

j)	  any HOMEOWNER action that has resulted in the issuance of a non-curable notice of default. 

OWNER encourages open discussion between itself and HOMEOWNER of any dispute which may arise between them in an effort to resolve that dispute.  Any attempt by any party to informally resolve a dispute shall not be deemed a waiver of that party's right to mediate or arbitrate the dispute.

16.5	The dispute resolution process is to be used for disputes between HOMEOWNER and OWNER and not disputes between HOMEOWNERS in COMMUNITY; however, if HOMEOWNER contends that another HOMEOWNER in COMMUNITY is violating one or more of these rules and regulations, HOMEOWNER may give OWNER notice in writing of the perceived violation, and OWNER will investigate it.  If OWNER concludes that a violation is occurring which unreasonably interferes with a HOMEOWNER’S peaceful enjoyment of COMMUNITY, OWNER will initiate the dispute resolution process by notifying the violating HOMEOWNER pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 16.6.

16.6	The dispute resolution works as follows:

a)	A party (HOMEOWNER or OWNER) initiates dispute resolution by giving written notice to the other party, in accordance with the lot rental agreement, of its desire to resolve a dispute by the dispute resolution process. To be effective, the written notice must specify that portion of the lot rental agreement or rules and regulations with which the dispute is concerned and offer two alternative dates/time in the following fifteen (15) day period when the party will be available to discuss resolution of the dispute.  If the notice is given by HOMEOWNER, it must also specify how HOMEOWNER proposes to resolve the dispute.  If given by OWNER, the notice must also specify what action OWNER proposes to take.

b)	After receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph 16.6(a), the receiving party will cooperate with the sending party in good faith to meet and discuss how the dispute might be resolved, with a view to reaching a resolution which takes into account the reasonable needs of all affected HOMEOWNERS in COMMUNITY and of OWNER.

c)	If the dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) days of the written notice specified in paragraph 16.6(a) having been sent, the party giving the notice will send a second written notice which refers to the first notice, specifies the portion of the lot rental agreement or rules and regulations concerned, and offers two alternative dates/times in the following fifteen (15) day period when the party will be available to discuss resolution of the dispute.  If the notice is given by HOMEOWNER, it must also specify how HOMEOWNER proposes to resolve the dispute.  If given by OWNER, the notice must also specify what action OWNER proposes to take.  If the action proposed by OWNER is assessment of a fine, the notice must specify the per day amount of the fine to be assessed.

d)	After receipt of a second notice as specified in paragraph 16.6(c), the parties will again cooperate in good faith to meet and discuss how the dispute might be resolved.  If the dispute has not been resolved after fifteen (15) days of the written notice specified in  having been sent, the dispute resolution process will be considered to be at an end, and any party may request mediation as set forth in section 16.1.  If a fine was assessed as a part of the dispute resolution process, the fine will be considered due and payable on the date the process is considered to be at an end.

16.7	Fines assessed by OWNER for violation of the lot rental agreement or these rules and regulations may not exceed $50.00 per day for a first violation.  If the HOMEOWNER against whom the fine is assessed has previously been assessed a fine for a similar violation, up to $100.00 per day may be assessed for the repeat violation.

16.8	OWNER may consider each day of a continuing violation for which an assessed fine is due and payable to be a separate violation to which the per day assessed fine applies, provided that OWNER so notifies HOMEOWNER in the second notice sent in accordance with paragraph 15.6(c).

16.9	HOMEOWNER’S payment of an assessed fine when due and payable is condition of occupancy, and failure of HOMEOWNER to pay an assessed fine when due is a basis for OWNER'S termination of the lot rental agreement.

16.10	Notwithstanding any other provision of the lot rental agreement or these rules and regulations to the contrary, neither HOMEOWNER nor OWNER will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees for any fees incurred in connection with the dispute resolution process set forth in this section.  The dispute resolution process is not intended to be a process in which representation of a party by an attorney will be necessary in order to effectively present that party's position.

16.11	No failure of OWNER to enforce any one of these rules and regulations shall operate as a waiver of its right to enforce that or others of the rules and regulations and to insist on strict compliance with the rules and regulations.

Manufactured homes are often clustered into manufactured home communities and in many areas of the country these communities have long faced considerable economic and regulatory impediments that can make expanding the supply of affordable housing more difficult for manufactured homes than for other types of housing. Resident-ownership of manufactured housing communities, or cooperatives (“Co-Ops”), are being promoted across the nation as a strategy for increasing affordable housing and as a way to increase the economic benefits of owning homes in manufactured housing communities.

Advocates of Co-Ops argue that resident-owned cooperative communities are an effective strategy for “preserving and improving affordable housing communities,” “building individual assets,” and “fostering, healthy, supportive communities,”1 but there is little evidence to date that suggests there are definitive benefits for the supply of affordable housing or the economic and financial well-being of cooperative owners beyond those that result from traditional, privately-owned communities. PolEcon completed and extensive research project on the impacts of Co-Ops in New Hampshire.2 Our 2008 research on the cooperative movement in NH used standard tools and methods of economic and housing market analysis and raised serious doubts about the claims of benefits made by advocates. Our report correctly pointed to the possible impacts that cooperatives would have on the supply of manufactured housing and raised concerns about the financial viability of highly leveraged cooperatives. We believe those concerns have been validated in the interim. In contrast, as the cooperative movement has been more broadly advocated across the nation, Co-Op advocates have yet to produce serious empirical research (that can be validated and replicated), that documents the impacts of Co-Ops on the supply of affordable, manufactured housing or the purported claims of economic and financial benefits that accrue to them.

Resident ownership of manufactured housing communities is an appealing story with appeal to many policymakers with real concerns about homeownership and the supply of affordable housing. Cooperatives have especially appeal to populists and believers in the greed and insensitivity of investors, owners, and landlords. Accurate or not, little of that would matter if cooperatives provided the affordable housing, economic, financial, and psychological benefits claimed by advocates. A proliferation of cooperatives is not an indication that they provide real economic, financial and housing benefits, however. Rather, it is an indication that advocates of cooperatives have assembled a combination of favorable financing, government subsidies, and supportive regulations that facilitate their growth. There are at lest four issues that should be considered by policymakers in considering the efficacy and desirability of proposals that facilitate or provide incentives for conversion of manufactured housing communities to resident- owned cooperatives:

•	What will be the potential long-run impact on the supply of manufactured and affordable housing? 
•	Will government and taxpayer subsidies be required to promote the cooperative model? 
•	What are the financial implications, on both cooperatives and home purchasers within them, of lending practices and underwriting standards that have been vilified as contributing to the recent housing crisis? 
•	Are there economic or financial gains for cooperatives and their homeowners above those realized in traditional, privately owned communities that would strongly warrant public subsidies?  Each of these issues is briefly discussed in this report. Psychological benefits to homeowners in cooperative also appear to be a primary benefit cited by advocates of cooperatives but they are less amenable to empirical investigation and outside of the expertise of PolEcon to evaluate.  

The Impact of Cooperatives on the Supply of Manufactured Housing  

Research on the supply of housing and its costs provides convincing evidence of how efforts to provide benefits to one group of citizens can have unintended and negative consequences for other citizens. The clearest and best example is rent control which is designed to make housing more affordable for some residents. Rent controls make rents more affordable for those residents in controlled units but evidence but an unintended consequence is that rents rise more rapidly in uncontrolled units and a reduction in overall housing investment (in part in response that new units may also someday become rent-controlled) also occurs.  There are several ways in which an increasing number of conversions to cooperatives could affect the supply of manufactured housing and ultimately impact the availability of affordable housing. 

		♦ €The primary sources of increased supply, developers and investors, may view the increase in Co-Ops as a sign of declining investment opportunities, a more hostile regulatory environment that minimizes returns on investment, or some other signal of a less favorable environment for expansion of manufactured housing and housing communities. The result would likely be a reduction in investments in manufactured housing, thus limiting a valuable source of affordable housing. 
		♦ €Similarly, owners and investors in manufactured housing communities may see a trend toward increased regulations and restrictions on their properties that reduce their economic value. 

In such a circumstance it is possible that more owners would look to convert their properties to alternate uses or hasten their conversions. In this case, the net number of new manufacture housing community units (the number of new units minus the number withdrawn) could decline or stagnate even as some new units or communities are being added.  Our 2008 research on housing trends in New Hampshire shows that the rapid rise in cooperative-ownership coincides with a decline in overall growth in manufactured housing units in pshire. As the number of housing units in communities increased dramatically this decade, the net increase in manufactured housing units fell dramatically.
The decline in net new manufactured housing units is not simply a function of a more general decline in new housing units in New Hampshire. The chart shows that in addition to the absolute declining trend in net new manufactured housing units, the percentage of new housing units in New Hampshire represented by manufactured housing also declined during the period of rapid increase in Co-Ops, falling from a high of about 12 percent in 1995 and 1996, to a low of under 3 percent by 2009.



Growth in Manufactured Housing is negatively related to the Presence of Co-Ops in a Town
Using more sophisticated, multivariate and econometric techniques, our 2009 research found that the presence of cooperatives in individual towns in New Hampshire was clearly related to slower growth in manufactured housing units compared to towns that had manufactured housing communities but no cooperatives. There are many more factors that influence the supply of manufactured housing but our results show a clear relationship between the presence of cooperatives in a community and slower growth in manufactured housing. These results were the first sophisticated attempt to empirically assess the impacts of Co-Ops on the supply of manufactured housing units. The results support some basic economic principles that suggest increasing barriers (or removing incentives) for private investment in an industry reduces the production or output in an industry.

Liberal Financing and Terms Produce Highly Leveraged Cooperatives and Homeowners

Establishing a cooperative requires both financial expertise and access to capital, two elements not typically available to residents of manufactured housing communities. Advocates of the cooperative movement promote cooperative ownership by supplying financial and management expertise and ready access to capital on extremely favorable terms that are not made available to investor-owned communities or to owners of manufactured homes in communities that do not have cooperative ownership. As advertised by ROC USA, these terms include financing 100% of the appraised value of communities.4 The NH Community Loan Fund has advertised mortgage financing for homes in co-ops up to 115% of appraised value in the past, although it is unclear if those terms are still available today. These types of “zero down payment,” low, or no equity, highly leveraged loans are widely thought to be a primary cause of the recent housing bubble and subsequent housing market crash and financial crisis in this country. Banks and mortgage companies were roundly criticized and subsequently subject to greater regulatory control as a result of making highly leveraged or zero down-payment loans.

The financial subsidies provided to Co-Op communities and homeowners should be assessed within the context of our understanding of the potential risks posed by highly leveraged real estate transactions. Our research in NH examined over 4,000 transactions in manufactured home communities in NH between 1999 and 2007. We found similar rates of foreclosure among homes in co-ops and investor-owned communities but that analysis was completed before the full impacts of the housing crisis occurred when the problems inherent in highly leveraged and zero equity mortgage loans were more likely to result in foreclosure than were less leveraged loans. Advocates Co-Ops, and of the liberal financing that allows residents to establish them, dismiss such concerns but to date but have not provided empirical data on the performance of the loans. Unlike financial institutions, the specialized organizations that arrange financing for cooperative conversions do not face the same reporting and regulatory requirements regulatory requirements as do most lenders. In essence, the performance of these loans is what cooperative advocates and their support organizations say they are. If they choose not to report a loan that is 90 days past due as in arrears, there is no publicly available mechanism (as there is with FDIC

4 See ROC USA http://www.rocusa.org/for-homeowners/financing.aspx .

quarterly bank “call reports” or credit union 5300 quarterly reports) to verify the performance and condition of their loans.
The number of emergency grants awarded to cooperatives previously documented in this report provides some indication of the financial position of many cooperatives and there have been several instances where board members of cooperatives have publicly stated their struggles to meet financial obligations.5
Although our research was conducted in 2008, during the beginning stages of the housing market crash and subsequent financial crisis, there was some evidence that greater forebearance was granted to delinquent mortgages in co-ops compared to mortgages in investor- owned properties. This likely occurred because the sources of financing (the NHCLF, ROC USA) and its partners and funders - foundations, tax credits, as well as banks as part of their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requirements were less compelled and under less scrutiny to enforce the provisions of these loans. In this circumstance, loans that traditionally perform more poorly (highly leveraged loans) in terms of default rates were more likely to be granted forbearance for delinquencies.

Promoting affordable housing and providing assistance to individuals in obtaining mortgages and purchasing homes are important and worthy public policy goals. However, the recent housing market crash and resulting financial crisis challenges the belief that public policies and public entities (think Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) or funds promoting that goal always have beneficial impacts. A clearer understanding of how cooperatives, homeowners in them fared during the recent housing crash should be required before public policies or funds are made widely available in promoting cooperatives. As we note in this report, over a period of just a few years, even a brief review of publicly funded housing grants revealed that 25% of cooperative in NH required some for of public subsidy for capital improvements.

The inherent subsidies given to Co-Ops (via favorable financing and direct grants for infrastructure investment from governmental, not-for-profit, and some private financial institutions, as well as greater forbearance in enforcing lending terms) can mask the financial difficulties encountered in the purchases of Co-Op communities or homes in a way that traditional communities cannot mask. It is relatively easy to increase the viability of cooperatives as long as financial institutions, and government and other grants are providing subsidies. Policymakers may, in fact, decide that such subsidies are desirable, and that promoting incentives for resident ownership are warranted but given the relatively high level of public subsidy they receive, it is may be more appropriate to call the resident and publicly-owned manufacturing housing communities rather than “resident-owned” communities.
 
 As an example the Medvil cooperative testified before a NH House committee looking at the issue of abandoned homes. Medvil board members indicated that they needed to be able to dispose of abandoned homes in their cooperative and rent those lots because their debt service was at 75% of revenues.
Resident-Owned Co-Ops Often Require Government Subsidies

Well-intentioned policies to support cooperatives often result in highly leveraged cooperative communities that may not be economically viable without substantial subsidies. Manufactured housing communities need periodic infrastructure improvements and investments. Lot rental fees in investor-owned communities must be high enough to build reserves or otherwise cover capital improvements in their communities. Community residents in investor owned parks can recognize the need for improvements but owners of communities are often criticized when lot fees are adjusted to cover these costs. Advocates of cooperatives often criticize owners of manufactured home communities for not making capital improvements and criticizing them for increasing rental fees when they do 
 
Advocates of cooperatives downplay the financial difficulties that confront cooperatives at the same time making it clear to potential cooperative owners that assistance in obtaining grant funding and subsidies will be made available. Cooperative owners face the same need to fund capital improvements (as well as other financial needs) as other communities. In NH, these needs have largely been met by obtaining public subsides in the form of government grants to fund inevitable capital improvements. Advocates thus argue for the benefits that “independence” that resident ownership and control may offer at the same time cooperative appear to increasingly rely on public subsidies for financial viability. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program in each state funded by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development agency and is one of the primary subsidies increasingly used by cooperatives in NH. Even an incomplete review of CDBG grant awards from the past 6 years6 shows that fully 25% of cooperatives in NH have obtained CDBG funding totaling more than $7 million.

The Economic Benefits of Cooperatives Have Not Been Empirically Demonstrated

There may be many reasons for promoting cooperatives, but results from our 2008 study, which used examined recorded deeds in over 4,000 manufactured homes sales in NH and which used an appropriate measures of economic gain (home price appreciation using a repeat-sales measure), showed that homes in Co-Ops do not offer the economic advantages over homes in traditional, privately-owned communities that are often cited by Co-Op advocates.

There is a vast literature in housing research that is applicable to Co-Ops. The various restrictions, etc. associated with Co-Ops function similar to more general land use and housing regulations. Regulations designed to benefit one group or homeowners or renters (in this case Co-Op homeowners) generally raise prices in the less regulated segment of the housing market. This has been near universally demonstrated with rent controls (a 1999 Fannie Mae study7 provides a solid review of the studies and evidence), but more generally research shows that housing restrictions and regulations of many types tend to increase prices in the “unrestricted” or “unregulated” segment of the market. Thus the proliferation of Co-Ops may be buoying appreciation of homes in traditional privately owned manufactured home communities in the same and neighboring towns.

		♦ €Our research indicates that the appreciation of homes in traditional privately owned communities exceeds that of homes in Co-Ops. o empirically valid measure has shown that homes in Co-Ops appreciate at a higher rate than do homes in traditional privately owned communities. A frequently cited (by Co-Op advocates) Consumer Union study measured appreciation using homeowner estimate of appreciation not actual market transactions and the NH Community Loan Fund study had no estimate of price appreciation but implied greater appreciation simply on the basis of initial sales price. 
		♦ €Both higher appreciation and higher volume of sales suggest that homes in traditional privately owned communities are in greater demand compared to homes in Co-Ops and are likely a more liquid asset than homes in Co-Ops (but neither should be considered a liquid asset).  6 Management of NH’s CDBG program has changed agencies (from NH Office of Energy and Planning to the Community Development Finance Agency) and previously available documents are not currently available on the Internet. 7 Early, D. W. and Phelps, J.T., “Rent Regulations’ Pricing Effect in the Uncontrolled Sector: An Empirical Investigation”, Journal of Housing Research, Vol 10, No. 2, 1999. 

Conclusions

Cooperative ownership of manufactured housing communities can provide benefits to residents, but it is important that these benefits not be promoted or subsidized in a manner that comes at the expense of the larger goal of increasing the supply of affordable housing options, or which increases the need for public subsidies and direct expenditures to accomplish these goals. To avoid potential unintended consequences, higher-quality research (than has been introduced thus far by advocates) on the impacts and implications of cooperative ownership of cooperatives is needed before policymakers embrace policies designed to facilitate them. The financial subsidies provided Co-Op communities and homeowners should be assessed within the context of our understanding of the potential dangers of high leverage learned from the recent housing and financial current crises. The inherent subsidies given to Co-Ops (via favorable financing and direct grants for infrastructure investment from governmental, not-for-profit, and some private financial institutions) can mask the financial difficulties encountered in the purchases of Co-Op communities or homes in a way that traditional communities cannot mask. Ultimately such risks may be warranted, but only if the benefits of cooperatives can be shown to clearly outweigh their risks of policies that promote them.

Ultimately such risks may be warranted, but only if the benefits of cooperatives can be shown to clearly outweigh their risks of policies that promote them.

"377","377","3","Phil Querin Q&A Home Reseller Paying Fees to Employees of Another Company","Question: Is it legal for a manufactured home reseller to pay referral fees to employees of another company who are not working under the reseller’s specific dealers license?


Answer: I cannot find any law precisely on point, so will have to “reason by analogy.” For purposes of answering the question, I will assume that the payor and the payee both have an Oregon manufactured structures dealer’s (“MSD”) license. However, that license only permits one to conduct business from a single location. If a person wanted to conduct business elsewhere, they would need to have a supplemental license (Form 440-2963).  See, statutes here. 

My concern with the payment of referral fees between separate dealers, is that it blurs the distinction between the “single location” requirement.  In other words, the payee would be receiving compensation from his own business location and another (unrelated) business location as well.  I would not be too concerned if the two locations where owned by the same person or entity, but if not, there could be regulatory problems with the responsible agency, Finance & Corporate Securities Division (“DFCS”).

Legally, there could  be additional ramifications.  Say the recipient of the fee made a misrepresentation to the customer, or there was a material defect in the home that resulted in injuries. If litigation ensued, the plaintiff would have two potential targets rather than one.  

Under the Oregon real estate licensing laws, one broker may pay a referral fee to another broker associated with an unrelated company.  However, this is expressly permitted by statute.  I see nothing in the statutes allowing MSDs to engage in referral fee activity, so would not recommend it without first checking with the DFCS.

Article provided by Kathleen Landau, Accounting Manager for Commonwealth Real Estate Services since 2009.  Kathleen brings over 20 years of accounting experience and knowledge to the Commonwealth team, and as a multi-site property owner herself, understands the unique needs facing property investors and small business owners.

###

So before I give you another accounting rule we are enforcing, let me say the goal is to protect your investment! We live in a very litigious society and need to be aware of potential risks and ways to protect our assets.   Commonwealth employees are insured through workers' compensation policies and also provided regular training regarding workplace safety.   Another area we are striving to improve risk management and compliance is in the area of hiring contractors. When a contractor is hired, the onsite manager must obtain verification that the contractor is licensed, bonded, and insured. In addition, a Form W-9 must be provided for purposes of reporting non-employee compensation on a Form 1099-Misc at the end of the year. 

The downturn in the economy resulted in many contractors allowing their insurance and licensing to lapse. We are currently working on two projects to confirm all contractors are still in compliance. The first will be a ""preferred vendor"" list by location. Commonwealth is compiling lists by geographic areas of approved vendors so in an emergency situation your onsite manager or regional manager knows what vendors have up-to-date information on file. Secondly, we will be combining this vendor list with our accounting program to alert us when we need to update the insurance information.  The reason to remind our customers of this policy is that some may have ""tried and true"" contractors that would not be eligible to work at the communities unless they can provide the necessary information requested OR become an employee to complete the task you wish to hire them for. I mention the latter as it is a legal remedy to tackling some of the small jobs that may be better served by hiring specialized temporary employees through agencies. Another option is hiring an individual on a task by task basis for their special skill. Commonwealth wants to be sure we are doing our best to protect your investment by limiting your risk exposure, both legal and financial, associated with contractors working at your communities.

Another reminder is that we do send 1099-Misc forms to all contractors annually. The form 1099-Misc reports all non-employee compensation. Amounts paid for employee compensation are reported on a Form W-2. Employees cannot receive a 1099-Misc and Form W-2 from the same employer for similar work. In order to keep away from any proof of control issues, our company policy is to send a W-2 to all employees and make sure all compensation for that individual runs through payroll. All independent contractor payments are reported on a 1099-Misc.

MHCO Legal Counsel

Re-Posted from November 25, 2013

_____________________________________________________________________

Introduction.  As you know, in the 2013 Legislative Session, we were able to defeat – or at least forestall – passage of HB 3007, a bill that extensively re-worked the current law governing resident park purchases.   However, MHCO and other stake-holders, agreed that we would work diligently to see if we could find a middle ground.  An interim work group of park industry representatives was appointed to do so.  In June 2013, the MHCO board unanimously voted to direct me to work with John VanLandingham to see if we could find a solution that did not expand the current park-purchase law, but rather mirrored currently existing protocol and clarified the landlord-tenant notification process. 

For the ensuing months, the interim work group held meetings with Rep. Gene Whisnant (Republican - Bend)) and Rep. Nancy Nathanson (Democrat - Eugene), seeking to develop legislation satisfactory to all concerned.  I worked closely with John VanLandingham during this time, as we emailed concepts back and forth. During the week of November 18-22, we aggregated these concepts into a written proposal for review by the interim group and Reps. Nathanson and Whisnant.  

At a meeting held on Tuesday, November 19, with some minor adjustments, I am happy to report that consensus was reached.  Summarized below – in broad strokes – are the major concepts that will be drafted into new legislation to replace the current right of first refusal law.  Caveat: Although preliminary consensus has been reached, there is no final bill yet, and much work remains to be done to see this though to a successful piece of legislation. 

1.	Landlord Notice to Tenants. The landlord would send a written notice to each resident and to the state housing agency at the time the landlord intended to commence marketing the park for sale, or upon receipt of an offer of purchase that the landlord intended to consider (whichever first occurs). The written notice would inform residents of the following: 
a.	That they have an opportunity to compete to buy the park; 
b.	They have 10-calendar days (the owner may offer more time) to notify the owner in writing that they are interested in competing to buy the park; 
c.	That within that 10-calendar day period the residents would designate a representative to communicate with the park owner; and
d.	Notify the tenants of the availability of the OHCS/MCRC handout regarding park purchase rights.
e.	The notice would be sent to all residents  unless there was already in place an active  park purchase committee (“PPC”). Alternatively, if there was an existing committee, such as a “committee of seven” as authorized under ORS 90.600(5) that would suffice for purposes of permitting the park owner to give notice to them, rather than every resident in the park.
 
2.	Landlord Right to Seek and Negotiate With Other Buyers: Throughout this process, the landlord is permitted to seek and/or negotiate with other buyers.

3.	Financial Information. Within the 10-calendar day period, the residents’ designated contact person may request the following financial information in order to evaluate a possible purchase.  The landlord would provide the financial information within seven (7) days following receipt of the request. 
a.	Asking price, if there is one;
b.	Annual park-covered utility expenses;
c.	Annual insurance expense (most recent premium);
d.	Current vacancies ;
e.	Income (lump sum, not by space) – including any park related profit centers, e.g. storage, etc. 
f.	The number of park-owned homes.

4.	Confidentiality. The landlord may designate the financial information “Confidential.” There will be a list of permissible transferees of this information, e.g. the purchase committee attorneys, tax advisors, etc. They can be required to sign a confidentiality agreement. The information provided to the purchase committee is to be returned to the landlord intact at the conclusion of negotiations or termination of purchase efforts. The tenants would have the right to review the information presented, but it could not be copied, in whole or in part. 

5.	Timing. Within 15 calendar days following receipt of the owner’s financial information, the purchase committee is required to:
a.	Form a corporate entity capable of purchasing the park or associate with a nonprofit corporation or housing authority capable of purchasing the park and/or providing park purchase assistance and advice; 
b.	Submit an offer to purchase the park in the form of a purchase and sale agreement (“PSA”) together with a copy of the filed corporate articles or other verification of legal capacity to purchase and hold title.
c.	The terms of the transaction, including offering price, due diligence duties, schedules, timelines, conditions and any extensions are to be spelled out in the PSA.
d.	The park owner and the purchase committee, including all park residents must act in a “commercially reasonable manner”  throughout the negotiations.  
During the 15-day period, the owner may accept the tenants’ offer, submit a counter-offer with different terms, or reject the offer. If accepted or countered the transaction moves forward according to the terms. If rejected, the transaction is over.  It is no different than in any other commercial transaction.

6.	Termination of Landlord’s Duty to Negotiate Further. The landlord’s duty to negotiate further ends:
a.	If the residents fail to act with the initial ten (10) calendar day period following the owner’s notice of intent to market the property;
b.	If they fail to form the purchase entity and/or fail to submit the PSA within the 15 day period following receipt of the landlord’s financial information; or 
c.	If the parties fail to reach agreement on the price and terms of a deal.

7.	Penalties for Noncompliance. An outrageous act in total disregard of the statutes would be a violation under the Landlord-Tenant Act (e.g. the landlord closed a sale without notifying the residents according to law), with a damage formula similar to what currently exists under the Act: E.g. $X per violation, or actual damages, whichever is greater.  Injunctive relief would be available if the residents learned that the owner was negotiating to sell the park without giving notice to residents.  

8.	Exemptions: All current exemptions are retained except transactions where the park owner is going to place the funds with an accommodator in order to secure a tax deferred exchange. 

That will not be included under the opportunity to purchase law.   An exemption for charitable remainder trusts will be added.  

9.	Affidavit of Compliance: The provision requiring a park owner to sign an affidavit at the time of closing, certifying that he/she complied with the law, will be retained. All title companies require this, and there was no reason to eliminate it.

10.	Remove Current Right of First Refusal Language: The current law attempted to give residents what it called a “right of first refusal.”  However, that term, which has a specific legal meaning, was never defined operationally.  How long did the right last? Could the owner negotiate with anyone else during that time?  These questions were never addressed in the law, and it is this kind of uncertainty that results in disputes and lawsuits.  This provision will disappear under the new law.

"423","423","3","Lessons From a $76,000 Fair Housing Settlement","By Jo Becker, Education/Outreach Specialist, Fair Housing Council 
Serving Oregon and SW Washington

In May 2013, Connecticut complainants were awarded over $76K (before attorneys’ fees) by the courts in The U.S.A v. Hylton.  This is a rental case but the ruling holds several important legal lessons for any housing provider.

The complaint alleged that the Hyltons, a Black married couple, violated the Fair Housing Act  (FHA) by refusing to allow a mixed-race couple, the Bilbos, to sublet their unit to a Black woman with children because they did not want ""too many Blacks"" at the property.

The decision awarded the following damages:
•	$31,750 to Mr. And Mrs. Bilbo because their landlord made discriminatory statements to them about being a mixed-race couple, and about the race of their prospective subtenant refusing to allow them to sublet the home to an African American woman and her children because of race. 
o	$10K of this sum was awarded for emotional distress.
•	Because Ms. Wilson, the prospective subtenant, was denied the home she sought and was qualified for, she continued to live in a racially concentrated area of poverty.  Her damages were awarded at $44,431.05
o	As part her damages, the court awarded Ms. Wilson $20K for compensation for the lost opportunity to live in a neighborhood of lower crime, higher educational opportunities, and greater upward mobility.  
•	Nearly half of the judgment, before attorneys’ fees, was for punitive damages.
•	An additional $37,422 in attorneys’ fees brings the total judgment against the defendants to over $113K.
Details of the case can be found online.
•	A summary of the case is available on the HUD site:  http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2011/HUDNo.11-198.
•	A summary of the ruling is posted on the DOJ’s site:  http://www.justice.gov/usao/ct/Press2013/20130812.html (DOJ).  
•	The court’s decision can be read at http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/connecticut/ctdce/3:2011cv01543/94677/23

The Hyltons were independent rental owners managing their own property.  They initially rented to the Bilbos; however, the Bilbos found that their personal circumstances required them to move and to break the lease agreement.  The Bilbos agreed to find a suitable renter to sublease to.  When they did the defendant asked if the person is white.  When told she was Black, Hylton stated that he “did not want too many Blacks at the property” and that “the neighbors would not want to see too many Blacks there.”  The defendant also told the Bilbos the only reason they were rented the house was because his wife is white and it was “a good mix.”

There are several salient points in this case, none of them new but none-the-less noteworthy.

MRS. MURPHY’S EXEMPTION
First, the housing providers in this case were ‘mom and pop’ landlords representing themselves.  Their blatant disregard for the law and others’ civil rights is clear from the case but the harm they caused – to the complainants and to their own pocketbook – may have been avoided with fair housing education and / or by hiring a professional manager who’s practice it was to know and abide by all federal, state, and local laws.  

As their defense, the defendants argued they were not subject to the Fair Housing Act given what is commonly referred to as the ‘Mrs. Murphy’s Exemption’ which states:
Any single-family house sold or rented by an owner provided that such private individual does not own more than three such single-family homes at anyone time… if such house is sold or rented (A) without the use in any manner of the sales or rental facilities or the sales or rental services of any real estate broker, agent, or salesman, or of such facilities or services of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings… and (B) without the publication, posting or mailing, after notice of any advertisement or written notice in violation of [the FHA].
Put plainly, small, independent landlords can discriminate based on protected class only if they do not hire a professional (thereby enjoining someone else in the act of discrimination) and if they do not ‘advertise’ a discriminatory preference.  Here, ‘advertising’ means, essentially, any outward expression ranging from verbal or written statements (ads whether printed or online, flyers, etc.).  Interestingly, in this case the property in question was held by Hylton Real Estate Management, which only Mrs. Hylton had an ownership interest in.  Because her husband, Mr. Hylton did not have an ownership interest in the company that owned the property only she, not he, qualified for this exemption.  Mrs. Hylton argued that the Mr. acted as her husband and not as ‘someone in the business of renting dwellings’ in dealing with the Bilbos.  However, Mr. Hylton himself stipulated that he was in the business of renting dwellings and detailed the tasks he performs in such capacity and, indeed, his behavior substantiated this.  All of that aside, his outward expression, or ‘publication’ of a discriminatory intent trumped the Mrs. Murphy’s Exemption binding him to the full responsibilities of the FHA, even if he had had an ownership interest in the property.  

It should be clearly noted  here that Oregon state law provides greater protection than federal and does not allow for the Mrs. Murphy’s Exemption.  Essentially, all housing providers must comply with federal, state, and local fair housing laws in Oregon.

VICARIOUS LIABILITY
Secondly, this case reaffirms what preexisting case law has already established in terms of vicarious liability.  As stated in the court’s decision, “Although Mr. Hylton is the individual who directly discriminated against Ms. Wilson and the Bilbos, both Mrs. Hylton and [the company] may be held vicariously liable for this discriminatory actions.” …‘It is clear under the FHA, owners of real estate may be held vicariously liable for discriminatory acts by their agents and employees.’ Glover v. Jones  Therefore, if Mr. Hylton was acting as Mrs. Hylton’s agent, Mrs. Hylton, as sole owner of [the property] is also liable for his discriminatory actions. See Cabrera v. Jakabovitz”

DAMAGES FOR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
Here, the court said it best in its decision:  “Third, as to the request for damages for emotional distress, ‘it is axiomatic that civil rights plaintiffs may recover compensatory damages for emotional distress.’  Ragin  It is not necessary for a plaintiff to provide evidence of treatment by a healthcare professional or use of medication to be entitled to damages for emotional distress.  See Parris v. Pappas…  (distinguishing “significant” and “egregious” claims for emotional distress from “garden variety” claims…).  In the context of Fair Housing Act violations, courts have ‘recognized the severe mental trauma associated with unlawful discrimination and have upheld large compensatory awards for the victims in such cases.’  Broome v. Biondi  ‘The key factors in determining emotional distress damages are the complainant’s reaction to the discriminatory conduct and the egregiousness of the respondent’s behavior.’  HUD v. Walker  When claims have been categorized as “garden variety” – meaning the claim for distress is devoid of evidence of medical treatment or physical manifestation – the amount of damages authorized ranges from $5,000 to $125,000.  Parris”

PUNITIVE DAMAGES
As stated above, the judge found in this case that the defendant acted with evil motive and showed no remorse justifying an award of punitive damages amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.

LOST HOUSING OPPORTUNITY DAMAGES
Finally, the issue of lost housing opportunity damages is also interesting.  Here the court found that Ms. Wilson suffered based on key testimony from an expert in the field of “neighborhood effects.”  The court concluded that there were “vast differences between the neighborhoods” in which she sought to leave and that which the subject property was located in amounting to “fewer ‘life chances’.”  

It’s clearly not only important to be familiar with the federal FHA, but to know applicable state, local, and case law, as well.  Issues such as vicarious liability, and what kinds of damages may be awarded, as well as other legal precedents such as disparate impact, what constitutes illegally discriminatory advertising, etc., should all be relevant to housing providers both at the company or organizational level and at the individual level.  As this case illustrates, the owner was personally liable for her agent’s actions, even though she did not directly violate the law.  This is true for ‘rank and file’ staff / employees / contractors as well, not just owners – that is, if a maintenance tech. or leasing agent violates the law, not only is the company and property owner liable, that individual may personally be sued as well.

MHCO Legal Counsel

Discussion:  MHCO has previously published a summary of the new 2013 laws directly impacting owners and managers of manufactured housing communities. The purpose of this article is to address the new landlord-tenant laws that apply to those situations in which park owners rent out park-owned homes.

HOUSE BILL 2639

Discussion: This Bill addresses several topics, including the creation of a ‘Housing Choice Landlord Guarantee Program” to mitigate damages to landlords’ dwelling units caused by tenants receiving Section 8 assistance, and revisions to state discrimination laws.  It applies to both tenants inside and outside of manufactured communities, i.e. regardless of whether the tenant owns their home or not. It becomes effective on July 1, 2014

SOURCE OF INCOME AND PAST CONDUCT IN SCREENING PROCESS 
•	Currently, a person may not, because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status, or source of income, refuse to sell, lease or rent any real property to a prospective renter/lessee.
o	“Source of income” now includes federal rent subsidy payments under Section 8 and any other local, state or federal housing assistance;
o	“Source of income” does not include income derived from a specific occupation or income derived in an illegal manner.
•	HB 2639 clarifies that the preceding prohibition does not prevent a person from refusing to rent or lease real property to a prospective renter/lessee based upon:
o	Their past conduct, so long as the refusal is consistent with local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to fair housing laws; or
o	The prospective renter’s/lessee’s inability to pay rent, taking into consideration the value of their local, state and federal housing assistance (e.g. Section 8).
•	Provided, however, the refusal to lease or rent based on the inability to pay rent must be consistent with local, state and federal law, including but not limited to fair housing laws.
•	Discussion. Regardless of the legal reason for rejecting a prospective renter/lessee, in all cases, landlords must be consistent with all applicants.  The risk and liability is very real; testers can find minor variations in a manager’s response, and depending upon what was said, claim that one tester was treated discriminatorily.  Similarly, owners and managers should always be consistent in following the screening criteria they have published.  If they do not rent to persons with a criminal record, they should be careful about making exceptions. It is the same for financial qualifications and ability to pay the rent.   

THE HOUSING CHOICE LANDLORD GUARANTEE PROGRAM
•	Definitions:
o	“Housing Choice Voucher Program” means the federal tenant-based assistance program established under Section 8 [42 U.S.C.   1437f(o)];
o	“Landlord” means an owner of a dwelling unit that has entered into an  agreement with a local housing authority to receive tenant-based assistance  payments under the Housing Choice Voucher Program and that has entered into  a rental or lease agreement with a tenant determined to be eligible to receive   assistance under the Housing  Choice Voucher pursuant to which the housing   authority is authorized to make tenant-based assistance payments to landlords within a designated area of operation under the Housing Choice Voucher Program. 
o	“Tenant” means an individual or a family who is determined to be eligible to receive tenant-based assistance payments under the Housing Choice Voucher Program and who has entered into a rental or lease agreement with a landlord.
•	The Housing and Community Services Department is to develop and implement the Housing Choice Landlord Guarantee Program for providing financial assistance to   landlords to mitigate damages caused by tenants as a result of occupancy under the Housing Choice Voucher Program.
•	Landlords eligible for assistance under the Housing Choice Landlord Guarantee Program must obtain a judgment against the tenant in the small claims court in the county which the property is located.
•	Assistance  is limited to reimbursement for only those amounts in the judgment that   are related to property damage,  unpaid rent  or other  damages:

"450","450","3","Occupancy By Who's Standard (Part 1 of 2)","By Jo Becker, Education/Outreach Specialist, Fair Housing Council 
Serving Oregon and SW Washington

I recently read an article on screening by a representative of a NW property management firm.  In it was included the company’s screening requirements, as well as what was apparently their stock occupancy standard for all units:  “Maximum occupancy of no more than two (2) persons per bedroom.”

There is a growing body of case law across the country in which housing providers – both landlords and condo / homeowners’ associations – have lost cases in which they’ve had two-people-per-bedroom policies.  At this point, we have not seen a housing provider loose a case with a two-plus-one policy1, so long as it takes into account other factors such as the overall size of the unit.  The recommendation we’re seeing come out of these cases is that housing providers ought to thoughtfully consider a separate occupancy standard for each, individual floor plan, based on several factors.

The Fair Housing Council has put out more than one article on occupancy standards and related fair housing implications (available at www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm) but this is a topic that continues to come up in classroom sessions and Hotline questions.  Having also just read a couple stunning reports detailing the legal and historical context for occupancy standards, I thought I’d dive back into the subject anew to reiterate fair housing cautions and share some very illuminating information.

What follows is the first in a two-part series detailing research and commentary by two occupancy policy experts and fair housing advocates.  In this article, we’ll look at the work of Tim Iglesias of the University of San Francisco School of Law as he explores the legal implications and disparate impact of overly restrictive occupancy policies, including two people per bedroom.  In the next article, the work of Ellen Pader, an anthropologist and Associate Director of the Housing Research Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst provides revealing historical and cultural perspectives behind our country’s occupancy policies.

THE PROBLEM
Tim Iglesias states clearly that “overly restrictive private ROS [residential occupancy standards]… substantially reduce the housing choices...  Demographic trends and the prolonged economic recovery which prompts more doubling-up promise this issue will only grow in importance.”  What’s more, there are profound societal fair housing implications, regardless of individual intentions.

Iglesias proffered some suggestions to the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in a document entitled Recommendations to HUD Regarding Application of the FHAA2 to Residential Occupancy Standards.  In it he states that, “the two-person-per-bedroom standard discriminates against families.  New empirical evidence demonstrates that this finding applies to substantial proportions of studios and one-bedroom apartments...”  He sites a study that “found that families with children run afoul of the standard more than ten times as often as other households.  Ten percent of families with children live in one-bedroom units, and nearly three-quarters of those families exceed the two-person-per-bedroom standard.  

In addition, regardless of the type of unit to which it is applied, the two-person-per-bedroom standard has a disparate impact across racial lines.  National studies show that the proportion of African Americans excluded by this occupancy standard is statistically significantly higher than for whites; the proportion of Asians excluded is higher than the proportion of blacks; and the proportion of Hispanics excluded is the highest of all.  Indeed, more than one-third of all Hispanic children living in one-, two-, or three-bedroom apartments in the United States in 2007-2009 would have been displaced by rigorous application of the two-person-per-bedroom standard.  Overall, the study found that when applied the two-person-per-bedroom standard substantially limits the housing choices of many thousands of families, especially Latinos, Asians and extended families.”  

Iglesias asserts in a 2011 Memo to Fair Housing Advocates that, “[t]his problem is particularly acute in nicer housing in neighborhoods with attractive amenities (e.g., good schools, access to shopping, jobs and medical care).”  

He also explains that two-person-per-bedroom, “has a dubious origin:
1.	There is no objective evidence that the two-people-per-bedroom standard was calibrated in any way to be a standard which presumptively avoided discrimination.
2.	and, the two-people-per-bedroom standard predates the 1988 FHAA, which was intended to be remedial legislation to address previous discriminatory practices against families.
3.	…research examining the historical origins of the two-person-per-bedroom standard has found that it was neither scientific nor otherwise objectively grounded, but merely the product of classist and ethnocentric paternalism.

According to Iglesias, “there is no objective evidence that the two-people-per-bedroom standard is necessary – much less uniquely suited – to protect landlords’ reasonable interests.
1.	Rather, [it] is merely the housing industry’s traditional standard.
2.	It’s really a prophylactic policy that errs widely on the side of protecting landlords’ interests and is not designed to avoid discrimination.
3.	Moreover, in jurisdictions where FHAPs [Fair Housing Assistance Programs] employ a “two-persons-per-bedroom-plus-one” enforcement guideline, there is no objective evidence that landlords using this more generous standard have suffered any so-called “overcrowding effects.”

“Arguments that the two-person-per-bedroom standard has legal force are weak.  Even if the Keating Memo3 has some legal force, it would be the whole memo, not the [two-person-per-bedroom] standard standing alone.”  The memorandum “provides that a two-person-per-bedroom standard is “presumably reasonable” (ambiguous but apparently meaning presumptively compliant with FHAA), but that all private residential occupancy standards are subject to a multi-factor analysis to determine whether or it violates the FHAA.”

THE HARM
The problems with overly restrictive occupancy policies are numerous, leaving a multitude of households with few options.  Many are harmed as they are forced to “reconfigure their household composition,” as Iglesias puts it, “[and] split up and deprive its members of their desired living situation.  Splitting up the family can conflict with deeply held cultural preferences / norms to live closely as a way of life and to keep together the intergenerational family, the extended family, or both.” 
If unwilling to “reconfigure its composition,” then the family must either:
•	secure more housing than desired which imposes additional costs,
•	accept inferior quality housing, such housing often poses health risks to residents or 
•	accept an inferior location, “…typically in an area with worse schools, more crime, and decreased access to jobs, transportation, shopping, and other amenities.  Cumulatively, movement to these inferior locations increases economic and racial segregation.”

“Finally, the denial of housing choice by the application of a restrictive residential occupancy standard may also constitute illegal discrimination.”  Iglesias goes on to site a multitude of cases that reference the discriminatory harms incurred by ROS3.

THE JUSTIFICATION
Why do landlords impose ROS?  Iglesias asks then answers the question:
1.	“They do this for a variety of reasons.  Some are legitimate some of the time, but they are often overstated.  And landlords have a hard time documenting a clear and direct linkage between a legitimate business reason and a particular ROS.
2.	Landlords’ traditional arguments for imposing a ROS are summarized by the phrase “overcrowding” and include: 
a.	preventing a variety of economic costs caused by so-called “overcrowding,” including concerns about future property value and profits, increases in “wear and tear” costs…, extra expenses for utilities and garbage, increased (risk of) damage to the property, increased insurance costs, and increased management costs;
b.	preventing nuisance-type harms to other tenants and neighbors from “overcrowding,” including noise and increased demands for parking;
c.	to promote often paternalistic concerns about the habitability / quality of life of tenants, including the safety and appropriateness of facilities for children and purported psychological harm to tenants from living in “overcrowded” spaces, and
d.	to avoid overtaxing the carrying capacity of one or more systems of the housing unit (e.g., water or sewage).”

THE PROBLEMS WITH THE KEATING MEMO
Iglesias argues that HUD’s enforcement practices have enabled the two-person-per-bedroom standard to become de facto law, but that new empirical evidence demonstrates this standard is often discriminatory.  Part of HUD’s implicit involvement includes what was issued as an internal document from a HUD staff, Mr. Keating, but which has come to be seen as an endorsement of two-people-per-bedroom policies.  (You can view the Keating Memo and subsequent guidance from HUD at www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm.)

As Iglesias notes, “[s]ometimes defendants seek to use HUD’s Keating Memorandum as a “defense” of two-person-per-bedroom standards because the Keating Memo states that this standard is “presumptively reasonable.”  While many courts have made reference to the Keating Memo and the two-person-per-bedroom standard, no court has ever properly analyzed whether it owes any deference to the Keating Memo.  Even if the Keating Memo is due some deference, such deference would be to the whole memo including its factors analysis…”

The Keating Memo is problematic for many reasons, including its use of the two-person-per-bedroom standard as “presumptively reasonable” and its lack of clarity in how to apply the factors it advices housing providers to consider, such as the size of bedrooms and the unit, the configuration of unit, other physical limitations of the housing, state or local law, and other relevant factors.

Iglesias notes that, “any private residential occupancy standard – including two-persons-per-bedroom – is subject to review using the factors stated in the [Keating] memo…  [T]he misunderstanding among many that the Keating Memorandum provides a “safe harbor” for landlords who impose a two-person-per-bedroom standard” has caught a growing number of housing providers by surprise.

Among other things, Iglesias urges HUD to “adopt a regulation to define the appropriate liability standard and defenses and to establish a true safe harbor for landlords.  The Keating Memorandum provides a useful form for this standard, but specifics need to be worked out.”  He goes on to theorize that “[i]f studies were conducted, they are likely to show that 2.5 people per bedroom or 3 people per bedroom is a more appropriate safe harbor, at least for studio and one-bedroom units.  The Keating factors must be further specified, e.g. setting the square footage of a regular-size bedroom and defining when additional habitable space requires allowing additional occupants.”

Check back here for the next in this two-part series.  Don’t forget to go back and take a look at FHCO’s earlier articles on occupancy policies posted at www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm for additional information in the meantime.  Of course, you can find information about familial status and race, color, and national origin and other protected classes at the Council’s site as well.

  At the Fair Housing Council (FHCO), we have long recommended a policy of two individuals per bedroom plus one more individual for the unit. For example, a housing provider might limit a two bedroom-home to five individuals. This ""two plus one"" formula can help insulate the housing provider from fair housing violations based on occupancy in most situations. That being said, additional factors should always be considered in developing individual policies. 
2 The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) of 1968 coupled with the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 protected the following classes in a housing:  race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (children), and disability.  Oregon law also protects marital status, source of income, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors.  Washington law covers martial status, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors, and honorably discharged veterans / military status. Additional protected classes have been added in particular geographic areas; visit FHCO.org/mission.htm and read the section entitled “View Local Protected Classes” for more information.

			</ul>
		<li>(2) A provision prohibited by subsection (1) of this section included in a rental agreement is unenforceable.

					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) The amount of any late charge may not exceed:</li>   
			<ul>	
				<li>(a) A reasonable flat amount, charged once per rental period. ""Reasonable amount"" means the customary amount charged by landlords for that rental market;</li>
				<li>(b) A reasonable amount, charged on a per-day basis, beginning on the fifth day of the rental period for which rent is delinquent. This daily charge may accrue every day thereafter until the rent, not including any late charge, is paid in full, through that rental period only. The per-day charge may not exceed six percent of the amount described in paragraph (a) of this subsection; or</li>
				<li>(c) Five percent of the periodic rent payment amount, charged once for each succeeding five-day period, or portion thereof, for which the rent payment is delinquent, beginning on the fifth day of that rental period and continuing and accumulating until that rent payment, not including any late charge, is paid in full, through that rental period only.</li>

		<li>(4) A landlord may not deduct a previously imposed late charge from a current or subsequent rental period rent payment, thereby making that rent payment delinquent for imposition of a new or additional late charge or for termination of the tenancy for nonpayment under ORS 90.394.</li>
		<li>(5) A landlord may charge simple interest on an unpaid late charge at the rate allowed for judgments pursuant to ORS 82.010 (2) and accruing from the date the late charge is imposed.</li>
		<li>(6) Nonpayment of a late charge alone is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause under ORS 90.392 or 90.630 (1). A landlord may note the imposition of a late charge on a nonpayment of rent termination notice under ORS 90.394, so long as the notice states or otherwise makes clear that the tenant may cure the nonpayment notice by paying only the delinquent rent, not including any late charge, within the allotted time.</li>
		<li>(7) A late charge includes an increase or decrease in the regularly charged periodic rent payment imposed because a tenant does or does not pay that rent by a certain date.

	<ul>
		<li>(1) A landlord, from time to time, may adopt a rule or regulation, however described, concerning the tenant's use and occupancy of the premises. It is enforceable against the tenant only if:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Its purpose is to promote the convenience, safety or welfare of the tenants in the premises, preserve the landlord's property from abusive use, or make a fair distribution of services and facilities held out for the tenants generally;</li>
				<li>(b) It is reasonably related to the purpose for which it is adopted;</li>
				<li>(c) It applies to all tenants in the premises in a fair manner;</li>
				<li>(d) It is sufficiently explicit in its prohibition, direction or limitation of the tenant's conduct to fairly inform the tenant of what the tenant must or must not do to comply;</li>
				<li>(e) It is not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord; and</li>
				<li>(f) The tenant has written notice of it at the time the tenant enters into the rental agreement, or when it is adopted.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) If a rule or regulation adopted after the tenant enters into the rental agreement works a substantial modification of the bargain, it is not valid unless the tenant consents to it in writing.</li>
		<li>(3) If adopted, an occupancy guideline for a dwelling unit shall not be more restrictive than two people per bedroom and shall be reasonable. Reasonableness shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. Factors to be considered in determining reasonableness include, but are not limited to:</li>

<h3>FEES AND DEPOSITS</h3>
 
<p><b><span id=""c295"">90.295 Applicant screening charge; limitations; notice upon denial of tenancy; refund; remedy.</b></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>(1) A landlord may require payment of an applicant screening charge solely to cover the costs of obtaining information about an applicant as the landlord processes the application for a rental agreement. This activity is known as screening, and includes but is not limited to checking references and obtaining a consumer credit report or tenant screening report. The landlord must provide the applicant with a receipt for any applicant screening charge.</li>
		<li>(2) The amount of any applicant screening charge shall not be greater than the landlord's average actual cost of screening applicants. Actual costs may include the cost of using a tenant screening company or a consumer credit reporting agency, and may include the reasonable value of any time spent by the landlord or the landlord's agents in otherwise obtaining information on applicants. In any case, the applicant screening charge may not be greater than the customary amount charged by tenant screening companies or consumer credit reporting agencies for a comparable level of screening.</li>
		<li>(3) A landlord may not require payment of an applicant screening charge unless prior to accepting the payment the landlord:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Adopts written screening or admission criteria;</li>
				<li>(b) Gives written notice to the applicant of:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The amount of the applicant screening charge;</li>
						<li>(B) The landlord's screening or admission criteria;</li>
						<li>(C) The process that the landlord typically will follow in screening the applicant, including whether the landlord uses a tenant screening company, credit reports, public records or criminal records or contacts employers, landlords or other references; and</li>
						<li>(D) The applicant's rights to dispute the accuracy of any information provided to the landlord by a screening company or credit reporting agency;</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(c) Gives actual notice to the applicant of an estimate, made to the best of the landlord's ability at that time, of the approximate number of rental units of the type, and in the area, sought by the applicant that are, or within a reasonable future time will be, available to rent from that landlord. The estimate shall include the approximate number of applications previously accepted and remaining under consideration for those units. A good faith error by a landlord in making an estimate under this paragraph does not provide grounds for a claim under subsection (8) of this section;</li>
				<li>(d) Gives written notice to the applicant of the amount of rent the landlord will charge and the deposits the landlord will require, subject to change in the rent or deposits by agreement of the landlord and the tenant before entering into a rental agreement; and</li>
				<li>(e) Gives written notice to the applicant whether the landlord requires tenants to obtain and maintain renter's liability insurance and, if so, the amount of insurance required.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(4) Regardless of whether a landlord requires payment of an applicant screening charge, if a landlord denies an application for a rental agreement by an applicant and that denial is based in whole or in part on a tenant screening company or consumer credit reporting agency report on that applicant, the landlord shall give the applicant actual notice of that fact at the same time that the landlord notifies the applicant of the denial. Unless written notice of the name and address of the screening company or credit reporting agency has previously been given, the landlord shall promptly give written notice to the applicant of the name and address of the company or agency that provided the report upon which the denial is based.</li>
		<li>(5) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a landlord need not disclose the results of an applicant screening or report to an applicant, with respect to information that is not required to be disclosed under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. A landlord may give to an applicant a copy of that applicant's consumer report, as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</li>
		<li>(6) Unless the applicant agrees otherwise in writing, a landlord may not require payment of an applicant screening charge when the landlord knows or should know that no rental units are available at that time or will be available within a reasonable future time.</li>
		<li>(7) If a landlord requires payment of an applicant screening charge but fills the vacant rental unit before screening the applicant or does not conduct a screening of the applicant for any reason, the landlord must refund the applicant screening charge to the applicant within a reasonable time.</li>
		<li>(8) The applicant may recover from the landlord twice the amount of any applicant screening charge paid, plus $150, if:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The landlord fails to comply with this section and does not within a reasonable time accept the applicant's application for a rental agreement; or</li>
				<li>(b) The landlord does not conduct a screening of the applicant for any reason and fails to refund an applicant screening charge to the applicant within a reasonable time.

		<li>(2) A landlord may charge a deposit, however designated, to an applicant for the purpose of securing the execution of a rental agreement, after approving the applicant's application but prior to entering into a rental agreement. The landlord must give the applicant a written statement describing:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The amount of rent and the fees the landlord will charge and the deposits the landlord will require; and</li>
				<li>(b) The terms of the agreement to execute a rental agreement and the conditions for refunding or retaining the deposit.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(3) If a rental agreement is executed, the landlord shall either apply the deposit toward the moneys due the landlord under the rental agreement or refund it immediately to the tenant.</li>
		<li>(4) If a rental agreement is not executed due to a failure by the applicant to comply with the agreement to execute, the landlord may retain the deposit.</li>
		<li>(5) If a rental agreement is not executed due to a failure by the landlord to comply with the agreement to execute, within four days the landlord shall return the deposit to the applicant either by making the deposit available to the applicant at the landlord's customary place of business or by mailing the deposit by first class mail to the applicant.</li>
		<li>(6) If a landlord fails to comply with this section, the applicant or tenant, as the case may be, may recover from the landlord the amount of any fee or deposit charged, plus $150. [1995 c.559 &sect;11; 2001 c.596 &sect;30; 2011 c.42 &sect;3]</li>

The landlord shall provide the tenant with a receipt for any security deposit the tenant pays. The landlord shall hold a security deposit or prepaid rent for the tenant who is a party to the rental agreement. A tenant's claim to the security deposit or prepaid rent is prior to the claim of a creditor of the landlord, including a trustee in bankruptcy.</li>
				<li>(b) Except as provided in ORS 86.782 (10), the holder of the landlord's interest in the premises at the time the tenancy terminates is responsible to the tenant for any security deposit or prepaid rent and is bound by this section.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(3) A written rental agreement, if any, must list a security deposit paid by a tenant or required by a landlord.</li>
		<li>(4) A landlord may not charge a tenant a pet security deposit for keeping a service animal or companion animal that a tenant with a disability requires as a reasonable accommodation under fair housing laws.</li>
		<li>(5)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a landlord may not change the rental agreement to require the tenant to pay a new or increased security deposit during the first year after the tenancy has begun. Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the landlord may require an additional deposit if the landlord and tenant agree to modify the terms and conditions of the rental agreement to permit a pet or for other cause and the additional deposit relates to the modification. This paragraph does not prevent a landlord from collecting a security deposit that an initial rental agreement provided for but that remained unpaid at the time the tenancy began.</li>
				<li>(b) If a landlord requires a new or increased security deposit after the first year of the tenancy, the landlord shall allow the tenant at least three months to pay the new or increased deposit.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(6) The landlord may claim all or part of the security deposit only if the landlord required the security deposit for any or all of the purposes specified in subsection (7) of this section.</li>

						<li>(B) To repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant, not including ordinary wear and tear.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(b) A landlord is not required to repair damage caused by the tenant in order for the landlord to claim against the deposit for the cost to make the repair. Any labor costs the landlord assesses under this subsection for cleaning or repairs must be based on a reasonable hourly rate. The landlord may charge a reasonable hourly rate for the landlord's own performance of cleaning or repair work.</li>
				<li>(c) Defaults and damages for which a landlord may recover under this subsection include, but are not limited to:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Carpet cleaning, other than the use of a common vacuum cleaner, if:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>(i) The cleaning is performed by use of a machine specifically designed for cleaning or shampooing carpets;</li>
								<li>(ii) The carpet was cleaned or replaced after the previous tenancy or the most recent significant use of the carpet and before the tenant took possession; and</li>
								<li>(iii) The written rental agreement provides that the landlord may deduct the cost of carpet cleaning regardless of whether the tenant cleans the carpet before the tenant delivers possession as described in ORS 90.147.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>(B) Loss of use of the dwelling unit during the performance of necessary cleaning or repairs for which the tenant is responsible under this subsection if the cleaning or repairs are performed in a timely manner.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(8) A landlord may not require a tenant to pay or to forfeit a security deposit or prepaid rent to the landlord for the tenant's failure to maintain a tenancy for a minimum number of months in a month-to-month tenancy.</li>
		<li>(9) The landlord must apply any last month's rent deposit to the rent due for the last month of the tenancy:</li>

				<li>(b) When the landlord and tenant agree to terminate the tenancy; or</li>
				<li>(c) When the tenancy terminates in accordance with the provisions of a written rental agreement for a term tenancy.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(10) A landlord shall account for and refund as provided in subsections (12) to (14) of this section any portion of a last month's rent deposit the landlord does not apply as provided under subsection (9) of this section. Unless the tenant and landlord agree otherwise, the tenant may not require the landlord to apply a last month's rent deposit to rent due for any period other than the last month of the tenancy.

If the tenant fails to restore a security deposit or prepaid rent under the provisions of this paragraph before the tenancy terminates, and the landlord retains no security deposit or prepaid rent from the tenant after the garnishment, the landlord is not required to refund or account for the security deposit or prepaid rent under subsection (11) of this section.

				<li>(b) Except as provided in this paragraph, a utility or service charge may only include the cost of the utility or service as billed to the landlord by the provider. A landlord may add an additional amount to a utility or service charge billed to the tenant if:</li>

						<li>(E) Any billing or notice from the landlord regarding the utility or service charge lists the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(c) A landlord may not require a tenant to agree to the amendment of an existing rental agreement, and may not terminate a tenant for refusing to agree to the amendment of a rental agreement, if the amendment would obligate the tenant to pay an additional amount for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage as provided under paragraph (b) of this subsection.</li>
				<li>(d) A utility or service charge, including any additional amount added pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection, is not rent or a fee.

				<li>(a) Pay the outstanding amount and deduct the amount from the rent; or</li>
				<li>(b) Terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice 72 hours prior to the date of termination and the reason for the termination.

The right of access of the landlord or landlord's agent is limited as follows:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) A landlord or landlord's agent may enter upon the premises under the tenant's exclusive control not including the dwelling unit without consent of the tenant and without notice to the tenant, for the purpose of serving notices required or permitted under this chapter, the rental agreement or any provision of applicable law.</li>
				<li>(b) In case of an emergency, a landlord may enter the dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant's exclusive control without consent of the tenant, without notice to the tenant and at any time. ""Emergency"" includes but is not limited to a repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious damage to the premises. If a landlord makes an emergency entry in the tenant's absence, the landlord shall give the tenant actual notice within 24 hours after the entry, and the notice shall include the fact of the entry, the date and time of the entry, the nature of the emergency and the names of the persons who entered.</li>
				<li>(c) If the tenant requests repairs or maintenance in writing, the landlord or landlord's agent, without further notice, may enter upon demand, in the tenant's absence or without the tenant's consent, for the purpose of making the requested repairs until the repairs are completed. The tenant's written request may specify allowable times. Otherwise, the entry must be at a reasonable time. The authorization to enter provided by the tenant's written request expires after seven days, unless the repairs are in progress and the landlord or landlord's agent is making a reasonable effort to complete the repairs in a timely manner. If the person entering to do the repairs is not the landlord, upon request of the tenant, the person must show the tenant written evidence from the landlord authorizing that person to act for the landlord in making the repairs.</li>
				<li>(d) A landlord and tenant may agree that the landlord or the landlord's agent may enter the dwelling unit and the premises without notice at reasonable times for the purpose of showing the premises to a prospective buyer, provided that the agreement:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Is executed at a time when the landlord is actively engaged in attempts to sell the premises;</li>
						<li>(B) Is reflected in a writing separate from the rental agreement and signed by both parties; and</li>
						<li>(C) Is supported by separate consideration recited in the agreement.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(e)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) If a written agreement requires the landlord to perform yard maintenance or grounds keeping for the premises:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>(i) A landlord and tenant may agree that the landlord or landlord's agent may enter for that purpose upon the premises under the tenant's exclusive control not including the dwelling unit, without notice to the tenant, at reasonable times and with reasonable frequency. The terms of the right of entry must be described in the rental agreement or in a separate written agreement.</li>
								<li>(ii) A tenant may deny consent for a landlord or landlord's agent to enter upon the premises pursuant to this paragraph if the entry is at an unreasonable time or with unreasonable frequency. The tenant must assert the denial by giving actual notice of the denial to the landlord or landlord's agent prior to, or at the time of, the attempted entry.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>(B) As used in this paragraph:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>(i) ""Yard maintenance or grounds keeping"" includes, but is not limited to, weeding, mowing grass and pruning trees and shrubs.</li>
								<li>(ii) ""Unreasonable time"" refers to a time of day, day of the week or particular time that conflicts with the tenant's reasonable and specific plans to use the premises.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>(f) In all other cases, unless there is an agreement between the landlord and the tenant to the contrary regarding a specific entry, the landlord shall give the tenant at least 24 hours' actual notice of the intent of the landlord to enter and the landlord or landlord's agent may enter only at reasonable times. The landlord or landlord's agent may not enter if the tenant, after receiving the landlord's notice, denies consent to enter. The tenant must assert this denial of consent by giving actual notice of the denial to the landlord or the landlord's agent or by attaching a written notice of the denial in a secure manner to the main entrance to that portion of the premises or dwelling unit of which the tenant has exclusive control, prior to or at the time of the attempt by the landlord or landlord's agent to enter.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) A landlord may not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. A tenant may not unreasonably withhold consent from the landlord to enter.</li>
		<li>(3) This section does not apply to tenancies consisting of a rental of space in a facility for a manufactured dwelling or floating home under ORS 90.505 to 90.840.</li>
		<li>(4) If a tenancy consists of rented space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home that is owned by the tenant, but the tenancy is not subject to ORS 90.505 to 90.840 because the space is not in a facility, this section shall allow access only to the rented space and not to the dwelling or home.</li>
		<li>(5) A landlord has no other right of access except:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Pursuant to court order;</li>
				<li>(b) As permitted by ORS 90.410 (2); or</li>
				<li>(c) When the tenant has abandoned or relinquished the premises.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(6) If a landlord is required by a governmental agency to enter a dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant's exclusive control, but the landlord fails to gain entry after a good faith effort in compliance with this section, the landlord may not be found in violation of any state statute or local ordinance due to the failure.</li>
		<li>(7) If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access or may terminate the rental agreement under ORS 90.392 and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. In addition, the landlord may recover actual damages.</li>
		<li>(8) If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but that have the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the reoccurrence of the conduct or may terminate the rental agreement pursuant to ORS 90.360 (1). In addition, the tenant may recover actual damages not less than an amount equal to one week's rent in the case of a week-to-week tenancy or one month's rent in all other cases.

			<ul>
				<li>(a) Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or a noncompliance with ORS 90.320 or 90.730, the tenant may deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after delivery of the notice if the breach is not remedied in seven days in the case of an essential service or 30 days in all other cases, and the rental agreement shall terminate as provided in the notice subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection. However, in the case of a week-to-week tenancy, the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than seven days after delivery of the notice if the breach is not remedied.</li>
				<li>(b) If the breach is remediable by repairs, the payment of damages or otherwise and if the landlord adequately remedies the breach before the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement shall not terminate by reason of the breach.</li>
				<li>(c) If substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior noncompliance of which notice was given recurs within six months, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement upon at least 14 days' written notice specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental agreement. However, in the case of a week-to-week tenancy, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement upon at least seven days' written notice specifying the breach and date of termination of the rental agreement.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) Except as provided in this chapter, the tenant may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief for any noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or ORS 90.320 or 90.730. The tenant shall not be entitled to recover damages for a landlord noncompliance with ORS 90.320 or 90.730 if the landlord neither knew nor reasonably should have known of the condition that constituted the noncompliance and:</li>   
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The tenant knew or reasonably should have known of the condition and failed to give actual notice to the landlord in a reasonable time prior to the occurrence of the personal injury, damage to personal property, diminution in rental value or other tenant loss resulting from the noncompliance; or</li>
				<li>(b) The condition was caused after the tenancy began by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of someone other than the landlord or a person acting on behalf of the landlord.</li>

<p><b><span id=""c365"">90.365</span> Failure of landlord to supply essential services; remedies.</b></p> 

	<ul>
		<li>(1) If contrary to the rental agreement or ORS 90.320 or 90.730 the landlord intentionally or negligently fails to supply any essential service, the tenant may give written notice to the landlord specifying the breach and that the tenant may seek substitute services, diminution in rent damages or substitute housing. After allowing the landlord a reasonable time and reasonable access under the circumstances to supply the essential service, the tenant may:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Procure reasonable amounts of the essential service during the period of the landlord's noncompliance and deduct their actual and reasonable cost from the rent;</li>
				<li>(b) Recover damages based upon the diminution in the fair rental value of the dwelling unit; or</li>
				<li>(c) If the failure to supply an essential service makes the dwelling unit unsafe or unfit to occupy, procure substitute housing during the period of the landlord's noncompliance, in which case the tenant is excused from paying rent for the period of the landlord's noncompliance. In addition, the tenant may recover as damages from the landlord the actual and reasonable cost or fair and reasonable value of comparable substitute housing in excess of the rent for the dwelling unit. For purposes of this paragraph, substitute housing is comparable if it is of a quality that is similar to or less than the quality of the dwelling unit with regard to basic elements including cooking and refrigeration services and, if warranted, upon consideration of factors such as location in the same area as the dwelling unit, the availability of substitute housing in the area and the expense relative to the range of choices for substitute housing in the area. A tenant may choose substitute housing of relatively greater quality, but the tenant's damages shall be limited to the cost or value of comparable substitute housing.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) If contrary to the rental agreement or ORS 90.320 or 90.730 the landlord fails to supply any essential service, the lack of which poses an imminent and serious threat to the tenant's health, safety or property, the tenant may give written notice to the landlord specifying the breach and that the rental agreement shall terminate in not less than 48 hours unless the breach is remedied within that period. If the landlord adequately remedies the breach before the end of the notice period, the rental agreement shall not terminate by reason of the breach.

		<li>(3) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, a landlord shall not be considered to be intentionally or negligently failing to supply an essential service if:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The landlord substantially supplies the essential service; or</li>
				<li>(b) The landlord is making a reasonable and good faith effort to supply the essential service and the failure is due to conditions beyond the landlord's control.</li>

		<li>(4) This section does not require a landlord to supply a cooking appliance or a refrigerator if the landlord did not supply or agree to supply a cooking appliance or refrigerator to the tenant.</li>
		<li>(5) If the tenant proceeds under this section, the tenant may not proceed under ORS 90.360 (1) as to that breach.
		<li>(6) Rights of the tenant under this section do not arise if the condition was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant or a person on the premises with the tenant's consent.</li>
		<li>(7) Service or delivery of actual or written notice shall be as provided by ORS 90.150 and 90.155, including the addition of three days to the notice period if written notice is delivered by first class mail.</li>
		<li>(8) Any provisions of this section that reasonably apply only to a structure that is used as a home, residence or sleeping place does not apply to a manufactured dwelling, recreational vehicle or floating home if the tenant owns the manufactured dwelling, recreational vehicle or floating home and rents the space.

The tenant must notify the landlord in writing that the tenant intends to do so. The giving of the notice provided by this subsection by the tenant does not constitute a termination of the tenancy.</li>

In addition, if the landlord knew or should have reasonably known of the existence of the conditions, the tenant may recover either two months' periodic rent or twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant as a result of the violation, whichever is greater. The tenant need not terminate the rental agreement to recover damages under this section. Within four days of the tenant's notice of termination, the landlord shall return to the tenant:</li>

			<ul>
				<li>(a) The complaint by the tenant was made to the landlord or an agent of the landlord in an unreasonable manner or at an unreasonable time or was repeated in a manner having the effect of unreasonably harassing the landlord. A determination whether the manner, time or effect of a complaint was unreasonable shall include consideration of all related circumstances preceding or contemporaneous to the complaint;</li>

				<li>(b) The tenant or someone in the tenant's control recklessly endangers a person on the premises other than the tenant by creating a serious risk of substantial personal injury;</li>
				<li>(c) The tenant, someone in the tenant's control or the tenant's pet inflicts any substantial personal injury upon a neighbor living in the immediate vicinity of the premises;</li>
				<li>(d) The tenant or someone in the tenant's control intentionally inflicts any substantial damage to the premises or the tenant's pet inflicts substantial damage to the premises on more than one occasion;</li>
				<li>(e)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The tenant intentionally provided substantial false information on the application for the tenancy within the past year;</li>
						<li>(B) The false information was with regard to a criminal conviction of the tenant that would have been material to the landlord's acceptance of the application; and</li>
						<li>(C) The landlord terminates the rental agreement within 30 days after discovering the falsity of the information; or</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(f) The tenant, someone in the tenant's control or the tenant's pet commits any act that is outrageous in the extreme, on the premises or in the immediate vicinity of the premises. For purposes of this paragraph, an act is outrageous in the extreme if the act is not described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection, but is similar in degree and is one that a reasonable person in that community would consider to be so offensive as to warrant termination of the tenancy within 24 hours, considering the seriousness of the act or the risk to others. An act that is outrageous in the extreme is more extreme or serious than an act that warrants a 30-day termination under ORS 90.392. Acts that are ""outrageous in the extreme"" include, but are not limited to, the following acts by a person:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Prostitution, patronizing a prostitute or promoting prostitution, as described in ORS 167.007, 167.008 and 167.012;</li>
						<li>(B) Manufacture, delivery or possession of a controlled substance, as described in ORS 475.005, but not including:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>(i) The medical use of marijuana in compliance with ORS 475.300 to 475.346;</li>
								<li>(ii) Possession of, or delivery for no consideration of, less than one avoirdupois ounce of marijuana as described in ORS 475.860 (3) or 475.864 (3); or</li>
								<li>(iii) Possession of prescription drugs;</li>
							</ul>
						<li>(C) Intimidation, as described in ORS 166.155 and 166.165; or</li>
						<li>(D) Burglary as described in ORS 164.215 and 164.225.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) If the cause for a termination notice given pursuant to subsection (1) of this section is based upon the acts of the tenant's pet, the tenant may cure the cause and avoid termination of the tenancy by removing the pet from the premises prior to the end of the notice period. The notice must describe the right of the tenant to cure the cause. If the tenant returns the pet to the premises at any time after having cured the violation, the landlord, after at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the subsequent presence of the offending pet, may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. The tenant does not have a right to cure this subsequent violation.</li>
		<li>(3) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, someone is in the tenant's control if that person enters or remains on the premises with the tenant's permission or consent after the tenant reasonably knows or should know of that person's act or likelihood to commit any act of the type described in subsection (1) of this section.</li>
		<li>(4) An act can be proven to be outrageous in the extreme even if the act is one that does not violate a criminal statute. Notwithstanding the references to criminal statutes in subsection (1)(f) of this section, the landlord's burden of proof in an action for possession under subsection (1) of this section is the civil standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</li>
		<li>(5) If a good faith effort by a landlord to terminate the tenancy under subsection (1)(f) of this section and to recover possession of the rental unit under ORS 105.105 to 105.168 fails by decision of the court, the landlord may not be found in violation of any state statute or local ordinance requiring the landlord to remove that tenant upon threat of fine, abatement or forfeiture as long as the landlord continues to make a good faith effort to terminate the tenancy.

The notice must specify the acts constituting the drug or alcohol violation and state that the rental agreement will terminate in not less than 48 hours after delivery of the notice, at a specified date and time. The notice must also state that the tenant can cure the drug or alcohol violation by a change in conduct or otherwise within 24 hours after delivery of the notice.</li>
		<li>(2) If the tenant cures the violation within the 24-hour period, the rental agreement does not terminate. If the tenant does not cure the violation within the 24-hour period, the rental agreement terminates as provided in the notice.</li>
		<li>(3) If substantially the same act that constituted a prior drug or alcohol violation of which notice was given reoccurs within six months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the violation and the date and time of termination of the rental agreement.

If the pet is not removed by the date specified, the tenancy shall terminate and the landlord may take possession in the manner provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168.</li>
		<li>(2) For purposes of this section, ""a pet capable of causing damage to persons or property"" means an animal that, because of the nature, size or behavioral characteristics of that particular animal or of that breed or type of animal generally, a reasonable person might consider to be capable of causing personal injury or property damage, including but not limited to, water damage from medium or larger sized fish tanks or other personal injury or property damage arising from the environment in which the animal is kept.

	<ul>
		<li>(1) If the rental agreement requires the tenant to give actual notice to the landlord of an anticipated extended absence in excess of seven days as permitted by ORS 90.340 and the tenant willfully fails to do so, the landlord may recover actual damages from the tenant.</li>
		<li>(2) During any absence of the tenant in excess of seven days, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit at times reasonably necessary.</li>
		<li>(3) If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make reasonable efforts to rent it for a fair rental. If the landlord rents the dwelling unit for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental agreement, the rental agreement terminates as of the date of the new tenancy. If the landlord fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental or if the landlord accepts the abandonment as a surrender, the rental agreement is deemed to be terminated by the landlord as of the date the landlord knows or should know of the abandonment. If the tenancy is from month to month or week to week, the term of the rental agreement for this purpose is deemed to be a month or a week, as the case may be.

<p><b><span id=""c417"">90.417</span> Duty to pay rent; effect of acceptance of partial rent.</b></p> 

	<ul>
		<li>(1) A tenant's duty regarding rent payments is to tender to the landlord an offer of the full amount of rent owed within the time allowed by law and by the rental agreement provisions regarding payment. A landlord may refuse to accept a rent tender that is for less than the full amount of rent owed or that is untimely.</li>
		<li>(2) A landlord may accept a partial payment of rent. The acceptance of a partial payment of rent in a manner consistent with subsection (4) of this section does not constitute a waiver under ORS 90.412 (2)(b) of the landlord's right to terminate the tenancy under ORS 90.394 for nonpayment of the balance of the rent owed.</li>
		<li>(3) A landlord and tenant may by written agreement provide that monthly rent shall be paid in regular installments of less than a month pursuant to a schedule specified in the agreement. Installment rent payments described in this subsection are not partial payment of rent for purposes of this section.</li>
		<li>(4) The acceptance of a partial payment of rent waives the right of the landlord to terminate the tenant's rental agreement under ORS 90.394 for nonpayment of rent unless:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The landlord accepted the partial payment of rent before the landlord gave a nonpayment of rent termination notice under ORS 90.394 based on the tenant's agreement to pay the balance by a time certain and the tenant does not pay the balance of the rent as agreed;</li>
						<li>(B) The landlord's notice of termination is served no earlier than it would have been permitted under ORS 90.394 had no rent been accepted; and</li>
						<li>(C) The notice permits the tenant to avoid termination of the tenancy for nonpayment of rent by paying the balance within 72 hours or 144 hours, as the case may be, or by any date to which the parties agreed, whichever is later; or</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(b) The landlord accepted a partial payment of rent after giving a nonpayment of rent termination notice under ORS 90.394 and entered into a written agreement with the tenant that the acceptance does not constitute waiver. The agreement may provide that the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168 without serving a new notice under ORS 90.394 if the tenant fails to pay the balance of the rent by a time certain.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(5) Application of a tenant's security deposit or prepaid rent to an obligation owed to a landlord in foreclosure under ORS 90.367 does not constitute a partial payment of rent.</li>
		<li>(6) Notwithstanding any acceptance of a partial payment of rent under subsection (4) of this section, the tenant continues to owe the landlord the unpaid balance of the rent. [2007 c.906 &sect;29; 2011 c.42 &sect;8a]</li>

				<li>(a) In the case of an abandoned manufactured dwelling or floating home but not including a dwelling or home abandoned following a termination pursuant to ORS 90.429 and except as provided by subsection (20)(d) and (e) of this section, if a lienholder makes a timely response to a notice of abandoned personal property pursuant to subsections (6) and (8) of this section and so requests, a landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the lienholder providing that the dwelling or home may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 12 months. A storage agreement entitles the lienholder to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.</li>
				<li>(b) The lienholder's right to a storage agreement arises upon the failure of the tenant, owner or, in the case of a deceased tenant, the personal representative, designated person, heir or devisee to remove or sell the dwelling or home within the allotted time.</li>
				<li>(c) To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the lienholder must enter into the proposed storage agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to the lienholder. The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage agreement to the lienholder in the same manner as provided by subsection (4)(b) of this section. The landlord may include a copy of the proposed storage agreement with the notice of abandoned property required by subsection (4) of this section.

				<li>(d) The storage agreement may require, in addition to other provisions agreed to by the landlord and the lienholder, that:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The lienholder make timely periodic payment of all storage charges, as described in subsection (7)(d) of this section, accruing from the commencement of the 45-day period described in subsection (6) of this section. A storage charge may include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.532, if limited to charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if incidental to the storage of personal property. A storage charge may not be due more frequently than monthly;</li>
						<li>(B) The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no greater than for late charges described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant; and</li>
						<li>(C) The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and obligations described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(e) During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord's approval of a purchaser or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval of any purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</li>
				<li>(f)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 90 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for the termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling or home without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
						<li>(B) After a landlord gives a termination notice pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for failure of the lienholder to pay a storage charge and the lienholder corrects the violation, if the lienholder again violates the storage agreement by failing to pay a subsequent storage charge, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
						<li>(C) A lienholder may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14 days' written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the rented space if the lienholder has paid all storage charges and other charges as provided in the agreement.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(g) Upon the failure of a lienholder to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the lienholder has sold or removed the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the lienholder.</li>

					</ul>
				<li>(b) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises; and</li>
						<li>(B) Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any personal representative or designated person, if actually known to the landlord.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to any personal representative or designated person, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.</li>
				<li>(d) If a personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession of the property, such as an heir or devisee, responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided by subsection (6) of this section and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the dwelling or home may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later. A storage agreement entitles the representative or person to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property. If such an agreement is entered, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder pursuant to subsection (19) of this section until the agreement with the personal representative or designated person ends.</li>
				<li>(e) If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement, subsection (19)(c), (d) and (f)(C) of this section applies, with the representative or person having the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.</li>
				<li>(f) During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the dwelling or home, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or devisee where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord's approval for occupancy of a purchaser, heir or devisee or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee of the dwelling or home upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</li>
				<li>(g) If the representative or person violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days' written notice to the representative or person stating facts sufficient to notify the representative or person of the reason for the termination. Unless the representative or person corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling or home without further notice to the representative or person.</li>
				<li>(h) Upon the failure of a representative or person to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative or person has sold or removed the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the representative or person.</li>

				<li>(c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to the heir, devisee, personal representative, designated person or estate administrator of the department, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.</li>
				<li>(d) The landlord shall allow a person that is an heir, devisee or personal representative of the tenant, or an estate administrator of the department, to remove the personal property if the person contacts the landlord within the period provided by subsection (6) of this section, complies with the requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable evidence that the person is an heir, devisee or personal representative, or an estate administrator of the department.</li>
				<li>(e) If neither an heir, devisee nor personal representative of the tenant, nor an estate administrator of the department, contacts the landlord within the time period provided by subsection (6) of this section, the landlord shall allow removal of the personal property by the designated person of the tenant, if the designated person contacts the landlord within that period and complies with the requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable evidence that the person is the designated person.</li>
				<li>(f) A landlord who allows removal of personal property under this subsection is not liable to another person that has a claim or interest in the personal property.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(22) If a governmental agency determines that the condition of a manufactured dwelling, floating home or recreational vehicle abandoned under this section constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law and the agency determines that the hazard endangers others in the immediate vicinity and requires quick removal of the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this subsection. The landlord shall comply with all provisions of this section, except as follows:</li>

				<li>(c) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be as provided in subsection (5) of this section, except that:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The dates and deadlines in the notice for contacting the landlord and removing the property must be consistent with this subsection;</li>
						<li>(B) The notice must state that a governmental agency has determined that the property constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard and must be removed quickly; and</li>
						<li>(C) The landlord shall attach a copy of the agency's determination to the notice.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(d) If the tenant, a lienholder, owner, personal representative or designated person does not remove the property within the time allowed, the landlord or a buyer at a sale by the landlord under subsection (11) of this section shall promptly remove the property from the facility.</li>
				<li>(e) A landlord is not required to enter into a storage agreement with a lienholder, owner, personal representative or designated person pursuant to subsection (19) of this section.

						<li>(B) That the landlord has hired, or will hire, a contractor to assess the level of contamination of the site and to decontaminate the site;</li>
						<li>(C) That upon hiring the contractor, the landlord will provide to the tenant the name, address and telephone number of the contractor; and</li>

	<ul>
		<li>(1) Subject to the policies of the utility or service provider, a landlord may, except as provided in subsections (2) to (5) of this section, provide for utilities or services to tenants by one or more of the following billing methods:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) A relationship between the tenant and the utility or service provider in which:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The provider provides the utility or service directly to the tenant's space, including any utility or service line, and bills the tenant directly; and</li>
						<li>(B) The landlord does not act as a provider.</li>
					</ul>

						<li>(C) The landlord:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>(i) Includes the cost of the utility or service in the tenant's rent; or</li>
								<li>(ii) Bills the tenant for a utility or service charge separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider's charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>(c) A relationship between the landlord, tenant and utility or service provider in which:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The provider provides the utility or service to the landlord;</li>
						<li>(B) The landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant's space; and</li>
						<li>(C) The landlord uses a submeter to measure the utility or service actually provided to the space and bills the tenant for a utility or service charge for the amount provided.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) A landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method as described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(ii) of this section:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) For garbage collection and disposal, unless the pro rata apportionment is based upon the number and size of the garbage receptacles used by the tenant.</li>
				<li>(b) For water service, if the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.</li>
				<li>(c) For sewer service, if sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(3) Except as allowed by subsection (2) of this section for rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010, a landlord and tenant may not amend a rental agreement to convert water or sewer utility and service billing from a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(i) of this section to a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(ii) of this section.</li>
		<li>(4) Except as provided in ORS 90.543 (3), a landlord for a manufactured dwelling park containing 200 or more spaces in the facility may not assess a tenant a utility or service charge for water by using the billing method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(ii) of this section.</li>
		<li>(5)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) A landlord of a manufactured dwelling park built after June 23, 2011, may use only the submeter billing method described in subsection (1)(c) of this section for the provision of water.</li>
				<li>(b) A landlord of a manufactured dwelling park that expands to add spaces after June 23, 2011, may use only the submeter billing method described in subsection (1)(c) of this section for the provision of water to any spaces added in excess of 200.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(6) To assess a tenant for a utility or service charge for any billing period using the billing method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(ii) or (c) of this section, the landlord shall give the tenant a written notice stating the amount of the utility or service charge that the tenant is to pay the landlord and the due date for making the payment. The due date may not be before the date of service of the notice. The amount of the charge is determined as described in ORS 90.534 or 90.536. If the rental agreement allows delivery of notice of a utility or service charge by electronic means, for purposes of this subsection, ""written notice"" includes a communication that is transmitted in a manner that is electronic, as defined in ORS 84.004. If the landlord includes in the notice a statement of the rent due, the landlord shall separately and clearly state the amount of the rent and the amount of the utility or service charge.</li>
		<li>(7) A utility or service charge is not rent or a fee. Nonpayment of a utility or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause under ORS 90.630. A landlord may not give a notice of termination of a rental agreement under ORS 90.630 for nonpayment of a utility or service charge sooner than the eighth day, including the first day the utility or service charge is due, after the landlord gives the tenant the written notice stating the amount of the utility or service charge.</li>
		<li>(8) The landlord is responsible for maintaining the utility or service system, including any submeter, consistent with ORS 90.730. After any installation or maintenance of the system on a tenant's space, the landlord shall restore the space to a condition that is the same as or better than the condition of the space before the installation or maintenance.</li>
		<li>(9) A landlord may not assess a utility or service charge for water unless the water is provided to the landlord by a:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Public utility as defined in ORS 757.005;</li>
				<li>(b) Municipal utility operating under ORS chapter 225;</li>
				<li>(c) People's utility district organized under ORS chapter 261;</li>
				<li>(d) Cooperative organized under ORS chapter 62;</li>
				<li>(e) Domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264; or</li>
				<li>(f) Water improvement district organized under ORS chapter 552.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(10) A landlord that provides utilities or services only to tenants of the landlord in compliance with this section and ORS 90.534 and 90.536 is not a public utility for purposes of ORS chapter 757.</li>
		<li>(11) The authority granted in this section for a utility or service provider to apply policy regarding the billing methods described in subsection (1) of this section does not authorize the utility or service provider to dictate either the amount billed to tenants or the rate at which tenants are billed under ORS 90.534 or 90.536.

	<ul>
		<li>(1) A landlord may unilaterally amend a rental agreement to convert the method of billing a tenant for garbage collection and disposal from a method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b) to a method in which the service provider:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Supplies garbage receptacles;</li>
				<li>(b) Collects and disposes of garbage; and</li>
				<li>(c)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Bills the tenant directly; or</li>
						<li>(B) Bills the landlord, who then bills the tenant based upon the number and size of the receptacles used by the tenant.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) A landlord shall give a tenant not less than 180 days' written notice before converting a billing method under subsection (1) of this section.</li>
		<li>(3) If the cost of garbage service was included in the rent before the conversion of a billing method under subsection (1) of this section, the landlord shall reduce the tenant's rent upon the first billing of the tenant under the new billing method. The rent reduction may not be less than an amount reasonably comparable to the amount of rent previously allocated for garbage collection and disposal costs averaged over at least the preceding year. Before the conversion occurs, the landlord shall provide the tenant with written documentation from the service provider showing the landlord's cost for the garbage collection and disposal service provided to the facility during at least the preceding year.</li>

A landlord may not unilaterally amend a rental agreement to convert utility and service billing from a method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(i) to a method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(ii).</li>
		<li>(2)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) As used in this subsection, ""occupied"" means that a tenant resides in the dwelling or home during each month for which the utility or service is billed.</li>
				<li>(b) A utility or service charge that is assessed on a pro rata basis to tenants for the tenants' spaces under this section must be allocated among the tenants by a method that reasonably apportions the cost among the affected tenants and that is described in the rental agreement.</li>
				<li>(c) Methods that reasonably apportion the cost among the tenants include, but are not limited to, methods that divide the cost based on:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The number of occupied spaces in the facility;</li>
						<li>(B) The number of tenants or occupants in the dwelling or home compared with the number of tenants or occupants in the facility, if there is a correlation with consumption of the utility or service; or</li>

	<ul>
		<li>(1) Notwithstanding ORS 90.534 (4) or 90.536 (3), a landlord may add an additional amount to a utility or service charge billed to the tenant if:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The utility or service charge to which the additional amount is added is for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;</li>
				<li>(b) The additional amount is not more than 10 percent of the utility or service charge billed to the tenant;</li>
				<li>(c) The total of the utility or service charge and the additional amount is less than the typical periodic cost the tenant would incur if the tenant contracted directly with the provider for the cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;</li>

<p><b><span id=""c537"">90.537</span> Conversion of billing method for utility or service charges.</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>(1) A landlord may unilaterally amend a rental agreement to convert a tenant's existing utility or service billing method from a method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b) to a submeter billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(c). The landlord must give the tenant not less than 180 days' written notice before converting to a submeter billing method.</li>
		<li>(2) A landlord must give notice as provided in ORS 90.725 before entering a tenant's space to install or maintain a utility or service line or a submeter that measures the amount of a provided utility or service.</li>
		<li>(3) If the cost of the tenant's utility or service was included in the rent before the conversion to submeters, the landlord shall reduce the tenant's rent on a pro rata basis upon the landlord's first billing of the tenant using the submeter method. The rent reduction may not be less than an amount reasonably comparable to the amount of the rent previously allocated to the utility or service cost averaged over at least the preceding one year. A landlord may not convert billing to a submeter method less than one year after giving notice of a rent increase, unless the rent increase is an automatic increase provided for in a fixed term rental agreement entered into one year or more before the conversion. Before the landlord first bills the tenant using the submeter method, the landlord shall provide the tenant with written documentation from the utility or service provider showing the landlord's cost for the utility or service provided to the facility during at least the preceding year.</li>
		<li>(4) A landlord that installs submeters pursuant to this section may recover from a tenant the cost of installing the submeters, including costs to improve or repair existing utility or service system infrastructure necessitated by the installation of the submeters, only as follows:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) By raising the rent, as with any capital expense in the facility, except that the landlord may not raise the rent for this purpose within the first six months after installation of the submeters; or</li>
				<li>(b) In a manufactured dwelling park, by imposing a special assessment pursuant to a written special assessment plan adopted unilaterally by the landlord. The plan may include only the landlord's actual costs to be recovered on a pro rata basis from each tenant with payments due no more frequently than monthly over a period of at least 60 months. Payments must be assessed as part of the utility or service charge. The landlord must give each tenant a copy of the plan at least 90 days before the first payment is due. Payments may not be due before the completion of the installation, but must begin within six months after completion. A new tenant of a space subject to the plan may be required to make payments under the plan. Payments must end when the plan ends. The landlord is not required to provide an accounting of plan payments made during or after the end of the plan.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(5) A landlord that converts to a submeter billing method under this section from the rent billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(i) may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submeters, convert the billing for common areas to the pro rata billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(ii) by including the change in the notice required by subsection (1) of this section. If the landlord continues to use the rent billing method for common areas, the landlord may offset against the rent reduction required by subsection (3) of this section an amount that reflects the cost of serving the common areas. If the utility or service provider cannot provide an accurate cost for the service to the common areas, the landlord shall assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed. This offset is not available if the landlord chooses to bill for the common areas using the pro rata method.</li>
		<li>(6) If storm water service and wastewater service are not measured by the submeter, a landlord that installs submeters to measure water consumption under this section and converts to a submeter billing method from the rent billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(i) may continue to recover the cost of the storm water service or wastewater service in the rent or may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submeters, convert the billing for the storm water service or wastewater service to the pro rata billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(ii) by including the change in the notice required by subsection (1) of this section. If the landlord converts the billing for the storm water service or wastewater service to the pro rata billing method, the landlord must reduce the rent to reflect that charge, as required by subsection (3) of this section.
		<li>(7) A rental agreement amended under this section shall include language that fairly describes the provisions of this section.</li>
		<li>(8) If a landlord installs a submeter on an existing utility or service line to a space or common area that is already served by that line, unless the installation causes a system upgrade, a local government may not assess a system development charge as defined in ORS 223.299 as a result of the installation.

		<li>(1) A landlord shall, upon written request by the tenant, make available for inspection by the tenant all utility billing records relating to a utility or service charge billed to the tenant during the preceding year. The landlord shall make the records available to the tenant during normal business hours at an on-site manager's office or at a location agreed to by the landlord and tenant. A tenant may not abuse the right to inspect utility or service charge records or use the right to harass the landlord.</li>

		<li>(2) A landlord that provides water to a manufactured dwelling park solely from a well or from a source other than those listed in ORS 90.532 (8) is not required to comply with subsection (1) of this section.</li>
		<li>(3) A landlord that meets the following requirements designed to promote conservation is not required to comply with subsection (1) of this section:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The landlord must:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Bill for water provided to a space using the pro rata billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(ii) by apportioning the utility provider's charge to tenants on a pro rata basis, with only the following factors being considered in the apportionment, notwithstanding ORS 90.534 (2)(c):</li>
							<ul>
								<li>(i) The number of tenants or occupants in the manufactured dwelling compared with the number of tenants or occupants in the manufactured dwelling park; and</li>

							</ul>
						<li>(B) Base two-thirds of the charge to the tenants on the factor described in subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph and one-third of the charge on the factor described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph.
						<li>(C) Determine the number of tenants or occupants in each dwelling unit and in the manufactured dwelling park at least annually.
					</ul>
				<li>(b) The landlord must demonstrate significant other conservation measures, including:
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Testing for leaks in common areas of the manufactured dwelling park at least annually, repairing significant leaks within a reasonable time and making test results available to tenants;</li>
						<li>(B) Testing each occupied manufactured dwelling and space for leaks without charge to a tenant occupying the dwelling at least annually and making test results available to the tenant;</li>
						<li>(C) Posting annually in any manufactured dwelling park office and in any common area evidence demonstrating that per capita consumption of water in the manufactured dwelling park is below the area average for single-family dwellings, as shown by data from the local provider of water; and</li>
						<li>(D) Taking one or more other reasonable measures to promote conservation of water and to control costs, including educating tenants about water conservation, prohibiting the washing of motor vehicles in the manufactured dwelling park and requiring drip irrigation systems or schedules for watering landscaping.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(c) The landlord must amend the rental agreement of each tenant to describe the provisions of this subsection and subsection (4) of this section and to describe the use of the pro rata billing method with additional conservation measures. The landlord may make the amendment to the rental agreement unilaterally and must provide written notice of the amendment to the tenant at least 60 days before the amendment is effective.
			</ul>
		<li>(4) If a landlord subject to this section adopts conservation measures described in subsection (3) of this section to avoid having to comply with subsection (1) of this section:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Notwithstanding ORS 90.539 or 90.725 (2), a tenant must allow a landlord access to the tenant's space and to the tenant's manufactured dwelling so the landlord can test for water leaks as provided by subsection (3)(b)(B) of this section.</li>
				<li>(b) The landlord must give notice consistent with ORS 90.725 (3)(e) before entering the tenant's space or dwelling to test for water leaks.</li>
				<li>(c) A tenant may be required by the landlord to repair a significant leak in the dwelling found by the landlord's test. The tenant must make the necessary repairs within a reasonable time after written notice from the landlord regarding the leak, given the extent of repair needed and the season. The tenant's responsibility for repairs is limited to leaks within the tenant's dwelling and from the connection at the ground under the dwelling into the dwelling. If the tenant fails to make the repair as required, the landlord may terminate the tenancy pursuant to ORS 90.630.</li>
				<li>(d) Notwithstanding ORS 90.730 (3)(c), a landlord is responsible for maintaining the water lines within a tenant's space up to the connection with the dwelling, including repairing significant leaks found in a test.</li>

				<li>(f) Notwithstanding ORS 90.534 (4), a landlord may include in the utility or service charge the cost to read water meters and to bill tenants for water if those tasks are performed by a third party service and the landlord allows the tenants to inspect the third party's billing records as provided by ORS 90.538.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(5) A tenant may file an action for injunctive relief to compel compliance by a landlord with the requirements of subsections (1), (3) and (4) of this section and for actual damages plus at least two months' rent as a penalty for noncompliance by the landlord with subsections (1), (3) and (4) of this section. A landlord is not liable for damages for a failure to comply with the requirements of subsections (1), (3) and (4) of this section if the noncompliance is only a good faith mistake by the landlord in counting the number of tenants and occupants in each dwelling unit or the manufactured dwelling park pursuant to subsection (3)(a) of this section.

The subleasing agreement shall include, but need not be limited to, provisions that require the dwelling or home renter to timely pay directly to the facility landlord the space rent, any separately assessed fees payable under the rental agreement and any separately billed utility or service charge described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b) or (c), and provisions that grant the dwelling or home renter the same rights as the facility tenant to cure a violation of the rental agreement for the facility space, to require facility landlord compliance with ORS 90.730 and to be protected from retaliatory conduct under ORS 90.765. This subsection does not authorize a facility tenant to rent a manufactured dwelling or floating home to another person in violation of the rental agreement between the facility tenant and the facility landlord.</li>
		<li>(2) Notwithstanding ORS 90.100 (47), a facility tenant who enters into a subleasing agreement continues to be the tenant of the facility space and retains all rights and obligations of a facility tenant under the rental agreement and this chapter. The occupancy of a manufactured dwelling or floating home by a renter as provided in a subleasing agreement does not constitute abandonment of the dwelling or home by the facility tenant.</li>
		<li>(3) The rights and obligations of the dwelling or home renter under a subleasing agreement are in addition to the rights and obligations retained by the facility tenant under subsection (2) of this section. The rights and obligations of the dwelling or home renter under the subleasing agreement are separate from any rights or obligations of the renter under ORS 90.100 to 90.465 applicable to the renter's occupancy of the manufactured dwelling or floating home owned by the facility tenant.</li>
		<li>(4) Unless otherwise provided in the subleasing agreement, a facility landlord may terminate a subleasing agreement:</li>

				<li>(b) If a condition described in ORS 90.380 (5)(b) exists for the facility space, by giving the renter the same notice to which the facility tenant is entitled under ORS 90.380 (5)(b); or</li>
				<li>(c) Subject to the cure right established in subsection (1) of this section and regardless of whether the landlord terminates the rental agreement of the facility tenant:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) For nonpayment of facility space rent; or</li>
						<li>(B) For any conduct by the dwelling or home renter that would be a violation of the rental agreement under ORS 90.396 or 90.398 if committed by the facility tenant.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>(a) If, during the term of a subleasing agreement, the facility landlord gives notice to the facility tenant of a rental agreement violation, of a law or ordinance violation or of the facility's closure, conversion or sale, the landlord shall also promptly give a copy of the notice to the dwelling or home renter. The giving of notice to the dwelling or home renter does not constitute notice to the facility tenant unless the tenant has expressly appointed the renter as the tenant's agent for purposes of receiving notice.</li>
				<li>(b) If the facility landlord gives notice to the dwelling or home renter that the landlord is terminating the subleasing agreement, the landlord shall also promptly give a copy of the notice to the facility tenant. The landlord shall give the notice to the facility tenant in the same manner as for giving notice of a rental agreement violation.</li>
				<li>(c) If, during the term of a subleasing agreement, the facility tenant gives notice to the facility landlord of a rental agreement violation, termination of tenancy or sale of the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the tenant shall also promptly give a copy of the notice to the dwelling or home renter.</li>

		<li>(3) The landlord may propose changes in rules or regulations, including changes that make a substantial modification of the landlord's bargain with a tenant, by giving written notice of the proposed rule or regulation change, and unless tenants of at least 51 percent of the eligible spaces in the facility object in writing within 30 days of the date the notice was served, the change shall become effective for all tenants of those spaces on a date not less than 60 days after the date that the notice was served by the landlord.</li>
		<li>(4) One tenant of record per eligible space may object to the rule or regulation change through either:</li>

		<li>(1) A landlord may terminate a month-to-month or fixed term rental agreement and require the tenant to remove a manufactured dwelling or floating home from a facility, due to the physical condition of the manufactured dwelling or floating home, only by complying with this section and ORS 105.105 to 105.168. A termination shall include removal of the dwelling or home.</li>
		<li>(2) A landlord may not require removal of a manufactured dwelling or floating home, or consider a dwelling or home to be in disrepair or deteriorated, because of the age, size, style or original construction material of the dwelling or home or because the dwelling or home was built prior to adoption of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5403), in compliance with the standards of that Act in effect at that time or in compliance with the state building code as defined in ORS 455.010.</li>
		<li>(3) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, if the tenant's dwelling or home is in disrepair or is deteriorated, a landlord may terminate a rental agreement and require the removal of a dwelling or home by giving to the tenant not less than 30 days' written notice before the date designated in the notice for termination.</li>
		<li>(4) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) State facts sufficient to notify the tenant of the causes or reasons for termination of the tenancy and removal of the dwelling or home;</li>
				<li>(b) State that the tenant can avoid termination and removal by correcting the cause for termination and removal within the notice period;</li>
				<li>(c) Describe what is required to correct the cause for termination;</li>
				<li>(d) Describe the tenant's right to give the landlord a written notice of correction, where to give the notice and the deadline for giving the notice in order to ensure a response by the landlord, all as provided by subsection (6) of this section; and</li>
				<li>(e) Describe the tenant's right to have the termination and correction period extended as provided by subsection (7) of this section.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(5) The tenant may avoid termination of the tenancy by correcting the cause within the period specified. However, if substantially the same condition that constituted a prior cause for termination of which notice was given recurs within 12 months after the date of the notice, the landlord may terminate the tenancy and require the removal of the dwelling or home upon at least 30 days' written notice specifying the violation and the date of termination of the tenancy.</li>
		<li>(6) During the termination notice or extension period, the tenant may give the landlord written notice that the tenant has corrected the cause for termination. Within a reasonable time after the tenant's notice of correction, the landlord shall respond to the tenant in writing, stating whether the landlord agrees that the cause has been corrected. If the tenant's notice of correction is given at least 14 days prior to the end of the termination notice or extension period, failure by the landlord to respond as required by this subsection is a defense to a termination based upon the landlord's notice for termination.</li>
		<li>(7) Except when the disrepair or deterioration creates a risk of imminent and serious harm to other dwellings, homes or persons within the facility, the 30-day period provided for the tenant to correct the cause for termination and removal shall be extended by at least:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) An additional 60 days if:
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The necessary correction involves exterior painting, roof repair, concrete pouring or similar work and the weather prevents that work during a substantial portion of the 30-day period; or
						<li>(B) The nature or extent of the correction work is such that it cannot reasonably be completed within 30 days because of factors such as the amount of work necessary, the type and complexity of the work and the availability of necessary repair persons; or
						<li>(b) An additional six months if the disrepair or deterioration has existed for more than the preceding 12 months with the landlord's knowledge or acceptance as described in ORS 90.412.
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(8) In order to have the period for correction extended as provided in subsection (7) of this section, a tenant must give the landlord written notice describing the necessity for an extension in order to complete the correction work. The notice must be given a reasonable amount of time prior to the end of the notice for termination period.</li>
		<li>(9) A tenancy terminates on the date designated in the notice and without regard to the expiration of the period for which, by the terms of the rental agreement, rents are to be paid. Unless otherwise agreed, rent is uniformly apportionable from day to day.</li>
		<li>(10) This section does not limit a landlord's right to terminate a tenancy for nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394 or for other cause under ORS 90.380 (5)(b), 90.396, 90.398 or 90.630 by complying with ORS 105.105 to 105.168.</li>
		<li>(11) A landlord may give a copy of the notice for termination required by this section to any lienholder of the dwelling or home, by first class mail with certificate of mailing or by any other method allowed by ORS 90.150 (2) and (3). A landlord is not liable to a tenant for any damages incurred by the tenant as a result of the landlord giving a copy of the notice in good faith to a lienholder.</li>
		<li>(12) When a tenant has been given a notice for termination pursuant to this section and has subsequently abandoned the dwelling or home as described in ORS 90.675, any lienholder shall have the same rights as provided by ORS 90.675, including the right to correct the cause of the notice, within the 90-day period provided by ORS 90.675 (19) notwithstanding the expiration of the notice period provided by this section for the tenant to correct the cause.

				<li>(a) Conversion does not require closure of the park pursuant to ORS 90.645 or termination of any tenancy on any space in the park or any lot in the planned community subdivision of manufactured dwellings.</li>
				<li>(b) After approval of the tentative plan under ORS 92.830 to 92.845, the manufactured dwelling park ceases to exist, notwithstanding the possibility that four or more lots in the planned community subdivision may be available for rent.</li>

						<li>(F) ORS 90.630 applies to a termination by a landlord for cause. However, the sale of a lot in the planned community subdivision occupied by a tenant to someone other than the tenant is a good cause for termination under ORS 90.630 that the tenant cannot cure or correct and for which the landlord must give written notice of termination that states the cause of termination at least 180 days before termination.</li>
						<li>(G) ORS 90.632 applies to a termination of tenancy by a landlord due to the physical condition of the manufactured dwelling.</li>

			</ul>
		<li>(2) A landlord is responsible for abandoned personal property and shall store, sell or dispose of abandoned personal property as provided by this section. This section governs the rights and obligations of landlords, tenants and any lienholders in any personal property abandoned or left upon the premises by the tenant or any lienholder in the following circumstances:</li>
			<ul>

					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(5) The notice required under subsection (3) of this section must state that:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The personal property left upon the premises is considered abandoned;</li>
				<li>(b) The tenant or any lienholder must contact the landlord by a specified date, as provided in subsection (6) of this section, to arrange for the removal of the abandoned personal property;</li>
				<li>(c) The personal property is stored on the rented space;</li>
				<li>(d) The tenant or any lienholder, except as provided by subsection (18) of this section, may arrange for removal of the personal property by contacting the landlord at a described telephone number or address on or before the specified date;</li>
				<li>(e) The landlord shall make the personal property available for removal by the tenant or any lienholder, except as provided by subsection (18) of this section, by appointment at reasonable times;</li>
				<li>(f) If the personal property is considered to be abandoned pursuant to subsection (2)(a) or (b) of this section, the landlord may require payment of storage charges, as provided by subsection (7)(b) of this section, prior to releasing the personal property to the tenant or any lienholder;</li>
				<li>(g) If the personal property is considered to be abandoned pursuant to subsection (2)(c) of this section, the landlord may not require payment of storage charges prior to releasing the personal property;</li>
				<li>(h) If the tenant or any lienholder fails to contact the landlord by the specified date or fails to remove the personal property within 30 days after that contact, the landlord may sell or dispose of the personal property. If the landlord reasonably believes the county assessor will determine that the current market value of the personal property is $8,000 or less, and the landlord intends to dispose of the property if the property is not claimed, the notice shall state that belief and intent; and</li>
				<li>(i) If applicable, there is a lienholder that has a right to claim the personal property, except as provided by subsection (18) of this section.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(6) For purposes of subsection (5) of this section, the specified date by which a tenant or lienholder must contact a landlord to arrange for the disposition of abandoned personal property must be not less than 45 days after personal delivery or mailing of the notice.</li>
		<li>(7) After notifying the tenant as required by subsection (3) of this section, the landlord:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Shall store the abandoned personal property of the tenant on the rented space and shall exercise reasonable care for the personal property; and
				<li>(b) Is entitled to reasonable or actual storage charges and costs incidental to storage or disposal. The storage charge may be no greater than the monthly space rent last payable by the tenant.
			</ul>
		<li>(8) If a tenant or lienholder, upon the receipt of the notice provided by subsection (3) or (4) of this section or otherwise, responds by actual notice to the landlord on or before the specified date in the landlord's notice that the tenant or lienholder intends to remove the personal property from the premises, the landlord must make that personal property available for removal by the tenant or lienholder by appointment at reasonable times during the 30 days following the date of the response, subject to subsection (18) of this section. If the personal property is considered to be abandoned pursuant to subsection (2)(a) or (b) of this section, but not pursuant to subsection (2)(c) of this section, the landlord may require payment of storage charges, as provided in subsection (7)(b) of this section, prior to allowing the tenant or lienholder to remove the personal property. Acceptance by a landlord of such payment does not operate to create or reinstate a tenancy or create a waiver pursuant to ORS 90.412 or 90.417.</li>
		<li>(9) Except as provided in subsections (18) to (20) of this section, if the tenant or lienholder does not respond within the time provided by the landlord's notice, or the tenant or lienholder does not remove the personal property within 30 days after responding to the landlord or by any date agreed to with the landlord, whichever is later, the personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned. The tenant and any lienholder that have been given notice pursuant to subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall, except with regard to the distribution of sale proceeds pursuant to subsection (13) of this section, have no further right, title or interest to the personal property and may not claim or sell the property.</li>
		<li>(10) If the personal property is presumed to be abandoned under subsection (9) of this section, the landlord then may:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Sell the personal property at a public or private sale, provided that prior to the sale:</li>
					<ul>

										<li>(III) The address and any space number where the personal property is located, and any plate, registration or other identification number for a floating home noted on the title, if actually known to the landlord;</li>

										<li>(V) Whether the landlord is accepting sealed bids and, if so, the last date on which bids will be accepted; and</li>
										<li>(VI) The name and telephone number of the person to contact to inspect the personal property;</li>
									</ul>
								<li>(ii) At a reasonable time prior to the sale, give a copy of the notice required by sub-subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph to the tenant and to any lienholder, by personal delivery or first class mail, except that for any lienholder, mail service must be by first class mail with certificate of mailing;</li>

				<li>(b) A person or nonprofit organization to whom the landlord gives the personal property pursuant to subsection (1)(b), (10)(b) or (11)(b) of this section.</li>

			</ul>
		<li>(15) The landlord is not responsible for any loss to the tenant or lienholder resulting from storage of personal property in compliance with this section unless the loss was caused by the landlord's deliberate or negligent act. In the event of a deliberate and malicious violation, the landlord is liable for twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant or lienholder.</li>
		<li>(16) Complete compliance in good faith with this section shall constitute a complete defense in any action brought by a tenant or lienholder against a landlord for loss or damage to such personal property disposed of pursuant to this section.</li>
		<li>(17) If a landlord does not comply with this section:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The tenant is relieved of any liability for damage to the premises caused by conduct that was not deliberate, intentional or grossly negligent and for unpaid rent and may recover from the landlord up to twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant;</li>
				<li>(b) A lienholder aggrieved by the noncompliance may recover from the landlord the actual damages sustained by the lienholder. ORS 90.255 does not authorize an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising under this paragraph; and</li>

			</ul>
		<li>(18) The provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a tenant to the abandoned personal property also apply to any lienholder, except that the lienholder may not sell or remove the dwelling or home unless:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The lienholder has foreclosed the lien on the manufactured dwelling or floating home;</li>
				<li>(b) The tenant or a personal representative or designated person described in subsection (20) of this section has waived all rights under this section pursuant to subsection (22) of this section; or</li>
				<li>(c) The notice and response periods provided by subsections (6) and (8) of this section have expired.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(19)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Except as provided by subsection (20)(d) and (e) of this section, if a lienholder makes a timely response to a notice of abandoned personal property pursuant to subsections (6) and (8) of this section and so requests, a landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the lienholder providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 12 months. A storage agreement entitles the lienholder to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.</li>
				<li>(b) The lienholder's right to a storage agreement arises upon the failure of the tenant or, in the case of a deceased tenant, the personal representative, designated person, heir or devisee to remove or sell the dwelling or home within the allotted time.</li>
				<li>(c) To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the lienholder must enter into the proposed storage agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to the lienholder. The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage agreement to the lienholder in the same manner as provided by subsection (4)(b) of this section. The landlord may include a copy of the proposed storage agreement with the notice of abandoned property required by subsection (4) of this section. A lienholder enters into a storage agreement by signing a copy of the agreement provided by the landlord and personally delivering or mailing the signed copy to the landlord within the 60-day period.</li>
				<li>(d) The storage agreement may require, in addition to other provisions agreed to by the landlord and the lienholder, that:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The lienholder make timely periodic payment of all storage charges, as described in subsection (7)(b) of this section, accruing from the commencement of the 45-day period described in subsection (6) of this section. A storage charge may include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.532, if limited to charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if incidental to the storage of personal property. A storage charge may not be due more frequently than monthly;</li>
						<li>(B) The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no greater than for late charges imposed on facility tenants;</li>
						<li>(C) The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and obligations described in the rental agreement that the landlord currently provides to tenants as required by ORS 90.510 (4); and</li>
						<li>(D) The lienholder repair any defects in the physical condition of the personal property that existed prior to the lienholder entering into the storage agreement, if the defects and necessary repairs are reasonably described in the storage agreement and, for homes that were first placed on the space within the previous 24 months, the repairs are reasonably consistent with facility standards in effect at the time of placement. The lienholder shall have 90 days after entering into the storage agreement to make the repairs. Failure to make the repairs within the allotted time constitutes a violation of the storage agreement and the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 14 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(e) Notwithstanding subsection (7)(b) of this section, a landlord may increase the storage charge if the increase is part of a facility-wide rent increase for all facility tenants, the increase is no greater than the increase for other tenants and the landlord gives the lienholder written notice consistent with the requirements of ORS 90.600 (1).</li>
				<li>(f) During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave the property on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions of ORS 90.680. The landlord may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</li>
				<li>(g)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(D) of this subsection, if the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 90 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for the termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
						<li>(B) After a landlord gives a termination notice pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for failure of the lienholder to pay a storage charge and the lienholder corrects the violation, if the lienholder again violates the storage agreement by failing to pay a subsequent storage charge, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
						<li>(C) A lienholder may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14 days' written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the facility if the lienholder has paid all storage charges and other charges as provided in the agreement.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(h) Upon the failure of a lienholder to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the lienholder has sold or removed the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(20) If the personal property is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant, this section applies, except as follows:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a tenant to the abandoned personal property shall apply to any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for the deceased tenant or any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant's death.</li>
				<li>(b) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises; and</li>
						<li>(B) Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any personal representative or designated person if actually known to the landlord.</li>

			</ul>
		<li>(22)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) A landlord may sell or dispose of a tenant's abandoned personal property without complying with the provisions of this section if, after termination of the tenancy or no more than seven days prior to the termination of the tenancy, the following parties so agree in a writing entered into in good faith:</li>
					<ul>

				<li>(c) If the prospective purchaser becomes a new tenant, the landlord may impose conditions or terms on the tenancy that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the seller's rental agreement only if the new tenant agrees in writing.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(8) A landlord may not, because of the age, size, style or original construction material of the dwelling or home or because the dwelling or home was built prior to adoption of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5403), in compliance with the standards of that Act in effect at that time or in compliance with the state building code as defined in ORS 455.010:</li>

The landlord may require as a condition of tenancy that a prospective purchaser who desires to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant must comply with the notice within the notice period consistent with ORS 90.632. If the tenancy has been terminated pursuant to ORS 90.632, or the notice period provided in ORS 90.632 has expired without a correction of cause or extension of time to correct, a prospective purchaser does not have a right to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant.</li>

Payment of the storage charges or maintenance of the dwelling or home and the space does not create or reinstate a tenancy or create a waiver pursuant to ORS 90.412 or 90.417. A former tenant may not enter the premises without the written permission of the landlord, including entry to maintain the dwelling or home or the space or to facilitate a sale.

"454","454","3","HB 4038A - Myths and Misconceptions","By:  Phil Querin, Querin Law.

[Remember, MHCO’s goal with HB 4038A was not to reinvent the wheel, but to make minimal changes to the current statute, amending only that which was in need of correction or change. That was always the consensus in this effort.]


 Under HB 4038A if an owner is considering selling his/her park, he/she must notify the residents. But what does “consider” mean?  I’m afraid that if I “consider” selling my park tomorrow that I will be required to then notify the residents. This is too vague! 

False. You have misread the proposed law. It does not say you must notify the residents just because you are “considering” selling your park. It only requires notice to the residents if you decide that you want to sell your park, or if you receive an offer that you “intend to consider.” This language is exactly the same as in the current law, and given the fact that heretofore, most park owners understood it, we saw no need for a change. You and you alone have the power to decide when you want to sell your park, or whether you will “intend to consider” an offer you have received. Hopefully, when that time comes, you will know instinctually in your gut what to do. It is that decision which triggers whether you will notify the residents.

 Park owners must send a notice of opportunity to purchase to every tenant in the park. Not necessarily. 

Under HB 4038A, the park owner may send the notice to an existing resident committee if one has been formed [whose purposes includes park purchases] and the owner has met with them within the preceding 12 months. This permits those owners who do not want to give notice to all residents to encourage the creation of such a resident committee in advance. HB 4038 now provides that honest errors in giving notices will not defeat the owner’s ability to sell the park to a third party. Keep in mind that notice to all residents is required in many other parts of the landlord-tenant act, such as rent raises, utility conversions, and rules changes.

 Park owners are at risk if they can’t find all residents for the notice. For example, if a tenant is renting the home to someone else. 

This comment demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of Oregon landlord-tenant law. To be a park tenant, one must both own and live in the home.
Absentee homeowners are not “tenants,” and occupying sub-tenants are not “owners.” (See, ORS 90.100 (47)(b).) In addition, Oregon law does not require landlords to “prove” that their tenant received a notice, only that it was given. (See, ORS 90.155.)

 Residents only have to notify the owner of their “interest” and there could be some that are interested and others not. There are no minimum requirements to determine how many residents must respond. 

Correct. This approach is contained in the existing law and was retained; we do not agree that MHCO or the legislature should ever try to dictate internal governance issues for park residents.

 The park owner must give financial information to all of the residents. 

False. HB 4038A put strict controls over dissemination of basic financial information that, if requested, will be turned over to a single representative designated by the residents. There are no comparable provisions under current law permitting a single point of contact. The documents can be marked “confidential”and include a list of persons to whom the information may be shared, such as financial advisors, attorneys, etc. The designated persons may not copy the material, and must return it upon completion of the process. This is not inconsistent with current standards of practice in commercial real estate transactions, where owners market their property for sale. The current park sale law says nothing about turning over financial information. This is a mistake, since residents need it in order to frame a meaningful offer. How can the residents’ experts establish value, without knowing basic income and expense information? All standard valuation models include a cap rate and/or a gross rent multiplier for commercial income property. Without basic information, any opportunity to purchase would be a meaningless; all serious third party purchasers would require it.

 The residents can submit an offer but aren’t required to provide proof of their financial capacity to close the transaction. 

As in the current law, there is no effort to dictate the terms of the residents’ offer. Our minimalist approach and goal was not to re-invent the wheel – but to keep things simple. HB 4038A says that the owner may accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. It does not require the owner to explain why he/she is accepting or rejecting. A tenant purchase offer that makes no effort to clarify their financial bona fides [e.g. by a lender’s pre-approval letter or other confirmation of financial capacity] is likely inviting a rejection. Landlords are not required to accept or counter weak offers. However, it is my own opinion, that park owners should always treat the residents’ offer with the same seriousness as any other third-party offer.

 The park owner can always reject the offer but takes the risk of being sued with an injunction blocking any other sale. 

Welcome to the real world. Anyone can sue anyone at any time. This risk has always existed under the current park sale law, and no amount of drafting will prevent that. Again, the goal was not to radically change the current park sale law, but to clean it up and clarify it where needed. The goal was never to make it more complex. Different from the current law, HB 4038A clarifies that if the owner sells the park and records an affidavit of compliance, the buyer and title company are absolutely protected. In other words, the sale cannot be set aside. That preserves the owner’s ability to convey marketable title. Additionally,
￼2
HB 4038A makes it clear that park owners may solicit other buyers throughout this process - something not addressed under current law.

 After they have received the financial information, residents have another 15 days to either form a corporate purchase entity or associate with a non-profit purchase group. What is an “associate”? A drinking buddy? This term is too vague! 

The question is nonsensical. Current law uses this term elsewhere without objection or confusion. The word “associate” may either be used as a verb (such as “to associate with a particular group”) or a noun (as in “I’d like to introduce you to my associate”). The text of HB 4038A is clear that the term “associate” is used in the verb form. This objection is either tongue-in-cheek, or the commenter does not understand the difference between verbs and nouns.

 HB 4 0 3 8 A has taken away the Sec. 1031 exclusion from park owners. 

False. If your buyer wants to exchange into your property under IRC 1031, there are limited time frames for his/her performance. This type of transaction is still exempted from the park sale law. You do not need to notify the residents. However, HB 4038A clarifies that if you want to exchange out of your property, that side of the exchange law is not exempted. Why? Because if you follow your expert’s advice you will have pre-identified the properties you want to exchange into as required by law. Only then do you need to notify the residents of your intent to market and sell the property. You are free to negotiate with the residents as well as any other prospective buyers at the same time. You do not have to hold up your exchange transaction, so long as you follow the protocols in HB 4038A. The residents cannot “make” you give up your 1031 rights. If their offer ignores your 1031 rights you may simply reject it. There was never any reason to exclude this side of the 1031 law from the residents’ opportunity to purchase. HB 3048A merely clears up this oversight. Park owners are not disadvantaged in any respect by this change.","By:  Phil Querin, Querin Law.

Serving Oregon and SW Washington

In our last article, we looked at the work of Tim Iglesias and the legal implications of, as well as the disparate impact of overly restrictive occupancy standards, including two-people-per-bedroom policies.  

In this article, the last in the two-part series, the work of Ellen Pader, an anthropologist and Associate Director of the Housing Research Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst we look at the historical and cultural perspectives behind our country’s occupancy policies.  

I recently read Ms. Pader’s Housing Occupancy Standards:  Inscribing Ethnicity and Family Relations on the Land, published in the Journal of Architectural and Planning Research in the winter of 2002.  Despite being more than a few years old, it is packed with – what for me – was stunning revelations about the deep and particularly contrived history of occupancy standards in the US.  As you read along with me, I ask that you do so with an open mind.  Step outside the lens of your role as a housing provider to gain greater perspective.  Warning:  Ms. Pader’s vocabulary is rich but dense; I hope the excerpts I have selected here are not too arduous.  That said, I strongly suggest you download the entire document (available at www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm) and read it over a cup of something yummy some long, rainy evening.  I’ll start you off with the verbose preface to Pader’s paper:

THE PREMISE

“Attempts to define family and the appropriate sociospatial arrangements for an idealized “normal” U.S. household formation have had profound influences on the design and size of houses, apartments, and communities throughout the twentieth century.  Based on ethnographic, historical, social, political, and legal research, this paper explores the sociopolitical construction of occupancy standards…  It concludes that the regulations drive from a combination of upper-class English ideals and outdated scientific knowledge, with concomitant moralistic and assimilationist aspirations on the part of the policy makers.  Today, these social ideals still implicitly underlie much of our current urban design, affecting the ethnic, racial, and economic structure of cities, and by extension, homelessness, coercive segregation, and access to services.”

THE CONFLICT

“The conflict at the base of this article is how we define and conceptualize housing discrimination on the basis of national origin and by extension… familial status…  This inevitably leads to an exploration of how mundane daily practice and macrolevel social policies are inextricably entwined with one another.  The daily practice in question here is sleeping arrangements… This directly influences where households with restricted means and more than four or five household members can live.

I am retheorizing the definition of ""national origin"" away from its legal definition of the place of origin of one's self or one's ancestors – and toward an anthropological definition of what it means to be from… a particular geographic locale. This means reframing the standard question derived from the 1949 Housing Act which set the goal that all citizens should enjoy ""a decent home and suitable living environment."" Thus, rather than asking ""Do all households, regardless of national origin or familial status, have equal access to decent housing?,"" I ask ""Do all households, regardless of national origin or familial status, have the same opportunity to decide for themselves what they consider acceptable and preferred living arrangements, and, therefore, have equal access to decent housing?"" 

…The basic questions are:  What is the basis and justification for current standards – which are generally some variation of no more than two people per bedroom?  How did this ratio become normalized and win over three people per bedroom, for instance; and why did bedrooms come into the talk of restricting occupancy anyway?  Even culturally mediated definitions of what should be counted as a bedroom have found their way into codes and legislation.  How did occupancy standards come to be such a bone of contention?

…This is not a call to remove occupancy standards altogether and return to the severely densely populated and ill-kempt tenements of early 1900s New York City; this is a call for a reappraisal of currently accepted standards. 

…Debates around regulating occupancy standards place us firmly in the blurry jurisdictional boundaries between courts and Congress.  Here, I will walk in that blur as I draw on some of the social, cultural, historical, political, and legal data that make up my argument as to why most current occupancy standards should be deemed illegal…

…Current occupancy standards and their rationales are historical and cultural artifacts that have been accorded the status of universal truth.  …The basic strands of my argument… are:

First: The general justification for current standards presume [they are] reasonable to the
ordinary person.  If I can demonstrate that they explicitly derive from, and refer to, upper-class,
English and Anglo-American definitions of reasonable, and that definition is in fact unreasonable to
many of the ethnicities in the U.S. exactly on account of where they or their ancestors are from and
what it means to be from there, then surely the prevailing definitions of ""ordinary"" and ""reasonable""
categories lose their privileged positions.

Second: The standards tend to be further justified under the rubric of providing for the health, safety, comfort, and convenience of the inhabitants. I argue that it is not [what] is being protected by the 2:I standard as purported. Rather it is a very specific, culturally constricted definition of moral health, safety, comfort and convenience. This is not to argue that less restrictive occupancy standards would similarly have no legitimate physical health, safety, and comfort rationale.

What is crowded to some is exactly what is comfortable to others; what is comfortable to some is
exactly what is lonely to others. Such differing reactions to spatial relations are largely the consequence of socialization and cultural practices, with implications beyond occupancy standards (Werner , et al., 1997).

[It should be noted that it] …is not just people who cannot afford more who share bedrooms.  In countries as different as Mexico and China people commonly choose to share bedrooms while leaving other bedrooms unused.  In a demographic study of household density in the U.S. using 1990 census data, researchers found that Latino and Asian households often have more than two people per bedroom even when their income is the same as White and Black households of the same size, again suggesting choice is at play, not economic necessity (Myers, et.al, 1996). 

…Sharing household space with extended family members is a common way of living throughout much of the world, and a common way of getting through hard times, or even strange times such as first entering a new country.  I have often been told when I have interviewed people from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, a home full of kin is not considered crowded as long as there is room on the floor.

…[And], what might have been justifiable on health grounds early in the twentieth century… has become antiquated due to modern medicine and technology.  …I often wonder what current policy-makers would say if they knew that their health and safety rationale was based on nineteenth century concepts about miasmas and vitiated, or impure air.  This cutting edge scientific knowledge of the late nineteenth century proved, without doubt, that one's own breath was full of deadly carbonic poisons and that some 40% of deaths in New York City were directly caused by breathing one's own self-inflicted noxious air –  you could drown in your own exhaled breath (Townsend, 1989; lanes, 1876).  This led to the perceived need to ensure the right combination of ventilation for dispelling the poisons to match the number of people in an enclosed space.

THE HISTORY

…[W]hile the occupancy standards might be facially neutral, that is they are equally applied to everyone across the board, their effect certainly is not, and their intent often is not either.

…In large part, occupancy standards derive from the tenement conditions of 19th / early 20th century New York, the Lower East Side in particular with its densely populated immigrant households.  As Social Darwinism was losing clout, other ways of denigrating the humanity of the largely Jewish, Polish, Italian, and Slavic populations were taking its place. It must be remembered that each of these non-WASP ethnic groups was considered a separate race; they were what historian David Roediger (1991) calls the 'not-yet-white,"" a concept with significant implications here.

Turn of the century urban tenements were pretty miserable.  No one was responsible for cleaning the
streets, buildings tended to be dirty, dark, poorly maintained, and often unsanitary (DeForest and
Veiller, 1903; lanes, 1876; Lubove, 1962; Veiller, 1910).  

…Like public and low-income housing today, there is a conflation of the now decrepit physical environment left to deteriorate by the government or private landlords with the moral character of the inhabitants.  …I wonder, should it be the character of the people who leave the housing to deteriorate, not the residents who have to live in that decrepitude, that is conflated with the condition of the property?

[For h]ousing reformers – who came from the middle- and upper-class establishment – …[t]he dominant belief of the era was that bad housing conditions, including too many people per unit according to their standards of uncomfortable crowding, directly produced illness, crime, intemperance, promiscuity, and the breakdown of the family.  Their goal was to bring order to what they considered to be disordered, and thereby dangerous.  The reapportionment of domestic space was one step in the orderly Americanization of these not-yet-white immigrants.

A 1905 survey [found] about 50% of the apartments housed three or four people per room, while 25% had five or more people (Takaki, 1993). The fairly new discipline of Public Health fought for the first building codes in New York State in 1867 through their organization, the American Public Health Association (APHA).  They wanted to contain the spread of contagious disease, both within the slums and from moving uptown.  Improving physical health was only one part of their mission; improving what they assumed to be a lapse in moral health was more important for justifying the push toward assimilation through restructuring domestic space, and in particular, sleeping arrangements.

…[W]hat constituted overuse of sleeping rooms to the Reformers (and most rooms were sleeping rooms in the tenements) was lack of physical privacy.  The ability to gain privacy by having one's own physically bounded space to sleep and think, was by now perceived as an essential necessity for healthful living. Too many people sharing, children sharing bedrooms with their parents, and of course, sharing with lodgers, 
almost inevitably means that there can be no provision for privacy or decency, and results in
sexual precocity and in many cases promiscuity, which may, of course, in time lead to a
criminal record. (Gries and Ford, 1932:xx)

This clearly articulated environmental deterministic view from the 1932 reports of President Hoover's Commission on Housing and Home Ownership is no different than the earlier views of [other] reformers.  Ironically, these moralists did not consider that many people in a room was a form of surveillance which might even mitigate sexual abuse.  If any sleeping arrangement is to be suspect… it should be private sleeping rooms with their closeable and lockable doors.

THE STANDARD

…The first occupancy standard in the U.S. was enacted in 1870 [in] San Francisco [and] required a minimum of 500 cubic feet of air space per person.  However. it was disproportionately enforced in Chinatown where low-paid, single, working Chinese men had no choice but to share rooms with less air space each than mandated.  In 1876 California made this minimum a state-wide law. 

…In 1879 New York City passed its first occupancy standard.  It required 600 cubic feet of air space per person.  This derived in part from the scientifically ""objective"" belief in miasmas and vitiated air, that one's own breath contained poisonous carbonic acids.  It was believed that without a minimal amount of space and renewable air, people could literally drown in their own breath (Townsend, 1989; lanes, 1876).  By 1901 this was decreased to 400 cubic feet for each adult and 200 for each child, still with an underlying, scientific health justification.

These early… laws provide an important caution:  Where does the line between caring for the plight of others and discrimination lie?  It is not always a clearly defined or overt line.  When does the desire to improve material conditions of the disenfranchised run a collision course with ethnocentrically derived moral platitudes?

…The reformers of the Progressive movement were largely responsible for getting occupancy standards enacted in order to improve the slum conditions and did at least replace the prevailing genetic interpretation of why certain groups predominated in many northern urban slums, with an environmental determinist interpretation, which is a step up.  

…Progressive concerns with the design and use of low-income immigrant housing were not simply
altruistic.  …Overcrowded and unsanitary apartments in urban neighborhoods also made 'productive' living very difficult (1988:82).  …housing was seen as an important political tool, to enhance both assimilation and worker productivity.

The emphasis on physically bounded privacy as a moral and even political good was part of the turn
of the last century public discourse.  Thus, in a 1905 speech, United States Commissioner of Labor,
Charles P. Neill pronounced that: 

[H]ome, above all things, means privacy. It means the possibility of keeping your family off from other families.  There must be a separate house, and as far as possible separate rooms, so that at an early period of life the idea of rights to property, the right to things, to privacy may be instilled.  (Wright, 1981:126)

…In the 1939 publication, Principles for Healthful Housing, the [American Public Health Association] wrote:
'A room of one's own' is the ideal in this respect; but we can at least insist on a room shared
with not more than one other person as an essential minimum.  Such a room should be occupied only by persons of the same sex except for married couples and young children. The age at which separation of sexes should occur is fixed by law in England at 10 years, but some American authorities would place the figure 2 years lower.  Sleeping-rooms of children above the age of 2 years, according to psychiatric opinion, should be separate from those of parents.  (p. 16)

…The British Act was explicitly a basis for the American Public Health Association's (APHA) reports
entitled Standards for Healthful Housing.  [These] then became the basis for the standards adopted by HUD and non-governmental standards creating agencies since the 1950s.

…In 1950 the APHA published:  “privacy in the home should be one of the fundamental objectives of
design… (p. 15-16).”  They also published a confession of sorts:  The minimum occupancy standards necessary to attain the goal of ""healthful housing ...closely approximates actual practice in the high- income groups"" (1950: xx, italics added), making explicit that one sector of society, the high-income primarily white northern European Protestant, had become the marker for all.

…the home design guidelines found in HUD's handbooks and most housing codes reiterate and help maintain certain culturally acceptable notions of proper personal and social behavior.  The same culturally imbued structural principles about privacy, privatization and proper moral behavior underlying the 2:1 codes guide the standard definition of a bedroom:  ""a bedroom cannot be a passthrough to another room"" (HUD, 1985:6-5).

…Conflated with this are questions of whether ""a room used for sleeping"" has to be a room labeled as a bedroom, and whether any non-passthrough which is not for instance, a bathroom or kitchen, can be counted as a bedroom for the purposes of establishing maximum occupancy.  The ambiguity here is at the basis of much legal and political action.

[An unpublished 1940 paper for the APHA explicitly states], “The health justification is to prevent interruption of sleep, but the moral argument is more commonly used” (APHA Archives). 

…These statements explicitly and intentionally privilege one culturally specific lifeway, discriminating
in the creation of the standards against people with different preferred modes of living, and against
Iow-income families with children.

…These seemingly neutral and healthy sociospatial relations found their way into the child raising dictates of a person who highly influenced how many of us were raised, Dr. Spock the baby doctor. 
Starting in the late 1940s, and continuing into later editions of Baby and Child Care, he wrote that
children should ideally have a room of their own ""where they can keep their own possessions under
control and have privacy when they want it."" (1976:201)

In the 1980s, another great arbiter of American culture, Dear Abby, wrote in What Every Teen Should Know:  Youngsters ""need a room to retreat to"" in order to help them grow as individuals…  (Van Buren: n.d.).

…[The moral argument] is based on the U.S. emphasis on individualism objectified in the continual reiteration of the necessity of physical privacy within the home to attain a particular concept of physical, psychological, and social health.  As I have suggested, in societies which value and practice interdependency, in which individualism and physical privacy are a punishment, a form of alienation, not a goal to be desired, one commonly finds house plans and social and spatial relations which correlate with and reinforce the concept of interdependency rather than independency (Pader, 1993).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Various municipalities and policy-makers are trying to change the local occupancy codes to limit the number of people who may live in a unit…  Not surprisingly, it is whoever are the current unwanted populations, the not-yet-white populations, that these codes are being used against.

For instance, in 1992, Brisefio v. the City of Santa Ana, the lawyer for Mr. Brisefio claimed the city
had racist intentions and was trying to rid the city of the growing number of people of Mexican origin (Brisefio v. City of Santa Ana, CA, 6Cal. App. 4th 1378 1992).  The judge feared that the impact of
the proposed ordinance would be greater homelessness and could find no compelling reason to permit the city to have a more restrictive policy than the state.  Other municipalities have passed restrictive occupancy policies and then lost them in court.

IN SUMMARY

…My point then is not to suggest that people from some ethnic groups prefer to be packed like herrings in a barrel.  Rather, it is to set a stage for less ethnocentric, more culturally inclusive occupancy standards.  Of course most people would like to be in a position to choose whatever size home they want, and then choose for themselves how to apportion the space – maybe by giving each person their own physically bound private space, or maybe by sharing all spaces with immediate and extended family, or maybe some other configuration altogether.  

In conclusion, I argue that what we are talking about here is not physical and psychological health and safety as the codes are supposed to protect, but moral health and safety from the perspective of early 20th century upper-class and mostly northern European reformers, transposed and naturalized into the late 20th /  early 21st century policies, and priorities about individualism, privacy, personal property, the body, responsibility, and social justice among other beliefs.  Then, they were explicit about their rationale.  Now it is just accepted as natural behavior.

And it is the people brought up to believe in the lessons of individualism through privately possessing one’s own space, as psychologically and physically essential for health, who write the policies, and who decide what is, indeed, reasonable to the ordinary person – and who decide what that ordinary person looks like.  In actual number, I would guess that the ordinary person they are talking about is in the minority, leaving out most ethnic groups, of all colors.

…What is needed is more discussion about reframing the definition of national origin to include what it means to be from a particular geographic locale within the context of understanding the intimate connections between social and spatial relations in the home, at the levels of the individual, the household, and of the larger society of which they are a part.  And then to accept the preference for sharing as equally legitimate as the preference for privacy.  To do less than this is being complicit in discriminatory housing policies.

…Sometimes I wonder what current debates would look like if the dominant mindset was [different].  Would more people be housed?  Would extended families and large families have greater opportunity to select where they want to live?  Would apartment developers move from the current trend of emphasizing two-bedroom units (which under current regulations tend to have the effect of eliminating many families with children) to larger ones to allow more nuclear and extended households to find housing of choice?”

I told you Ms. Pader was loquacious!  That said, her paper illuminates much little-known history and purports some challenging, if not compelling, arguments.

  The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) of 1968 coupled with the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 protected the following classes in a housing:  race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (children), and disability.  Oregon law also protects marital status, source of income, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors.  Washington law covers martial status, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors, and honorably discharged veterans / military status. Additional protected classes have been added in particular geographic areas; visit FHCO.org/mission.htm and read the section entitled “View Local Protected Classes” for more information.
2 At the Fair Housing Council (FHCO), we have long recommended a policy of two individuals per bedroom plus one more individual for the unit. For example, a housing provider might limit a two bedroom-home to five individuals. This ""two plus one"" formula can help insulate the housing provider from fair housing violations based on occupancy in most situations. That being said, additional factors should always be considered in developing individual policies.

"489","489","3","MEASURE TO PRESERVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MANUFACTURED HOUSING  CLEARS KEY HURDLE IN U.S. HOUSE","The House Financial Services Committee Passes Bipartisan Legislation to Protect the Availability of Financing for Manufactured Homes

(Editor's Note:  As mentioned in the earlier article with the passage of similar legislation pending in the US Senate, MHCO is working with the Oregon Congressional delegation to ensure passage of this critical legislation.)

Washington, DC - The U.S. House Financial Services Committee today passed the bipartisan Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act (H.R. 1779) to protect the ability of manufactured home customers to buy, sell and refinance affordable manufactured homes, the largest form of unsubsidized affordable housing in the nation. Specifically, the bill would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) to address the criteria by which home loans are classified ""high-cost"" while keeping in place strong consumer protections. Sponsored by Representatives Stephen Fincher (R-TN), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), and Gary Miller (R-CA), the bill is also supported and cosponsored by an additional 110 House Members on both sides of the aisle. 

""The ability to access affordable manufactured homes is vital to millions of low- and moderate-income Americans, and our industry is also an important economic driver and job creator in many communities across the country,"" said Nathan Smith, Chairman of the Manufactured Housing Institute. ""This legislation would ensure that manufactured housing remains a viable affordable housing option, particularly in rural, distressed and underserved areas. We urge the full House of Representative to move swiftly to consider this important legislation.""

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), through a rulemaking process required under Dodd-Frank, deemed that all purchase loans-including mortgages on manufactured homes considered personal property-be covered by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). Under these guidelines, many small-balance loans used for the purchase of affordable manufactured housing are now unfairly classified as predatory and high-cost. Unfortunately, the CFPB failed to recognize the uniqueness of manufactured home loans compared to the rest of the housing industry.

While the cost of originating and servicing a $250,000 loan and a $25,000 loan are the same in terms of real dollars, the cost as a percentage of each loan's size is significantly different. This difference causes the smaller-sized manufactured home loan to potentially exceed the new thresholds and be categorized as a HOEPA high-cost loan. 

Due to the increased lender liabilities associated with making a HOEPA high-cost loan, it is unlikely that these loans will be offered to homebuyers, denying access to necessary credit for new and existing manufactured homes. In fact, industry lenders have already stopped originating loans of less than $20,000 as a result of the new rule. According to the American Housing Survey, roughly half of the nation's 8.5 million manufactured homes have a purchase price of less than $30,000.

Manufactured home loans perform just as well, if not better, than loans on site-built counterparts and are serviced in a responsible and consumer-friendly manner. This is evidenced by delinquency rates among manufactured housing lenders that are half of what is reported in the larger mortgage market. 

Eliminating this important source of financing would unfairly penalize low and moderate-income homebuyers who do not qualify for traditional mortgage financing needed for single family home ownership; do not have access to limited government-insured and GSE secondary market programs; or live in rural areas where affordable rental housing is scarce or non-existent. Additionally, millions of families could see the equity they have diligently built up in their manufactured homes wiped out because lenders would be unwilling to provide the financing needed for resale.

""Homeowners who purchased safe, energy efficient homes that they can afford rather than taking out a loan they could not pay back should not be punished, and we are thankful so many lawmakers have backed this effort to protect the more than 22 million Americans living in manufactured homes,"" added Smith.

The bipartisan legislation would also clarify that manufactured home retailers and salespersons would not be considered loan originators unless they receive compensation from a lender, mortgage broker or loan originator. The new CFPB definition of a loan originator is based on traditional mortgage market roles that do not equate with the business model of the manufactured housing industry, including lending and retail sales practices. 

A similar bipartisan bill has been introduced in the Senate, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2013 (S. 1828), by Senators Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Tom Coburn (R-OK).

"495","495","3","RV Park Question and Answer with Attorney Mark Busch - Discrimination Claims by RV Tenants","By Mark L. Busch, P.C., Attorney at Law

Question: A manufactured home community has an RV section.  Community management is aware that the Federal Fair Housing laws apply to manufactured home community tenants and that the community cannot discriminate against protected groups when renting manufactured home spaces.  Do the same laws apply to RV tenants?  Does it matter if they are short-term vacation occupancy RVs as opposed to longer term space rental RVs?

Answer: Generally the short answer is yes, the Federal Fair Housing laws apply to RV rentals.  It also does not matter whether the RV rental is a vacation occupancy rental or a long-term rental.  The discrimination laws apply either way.

Specifically, the Federal Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) prohibits discrimination in the rental of a “dwelling” based upon race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.  ""Dwelling"" includes any vacant land which is offered for lease for locating any “structure” on it. A structure would include an RV.

(Note:  State fair housing statutes also protect against discrimination based upon race, color, sex, marital status, source of income (excluding Section 8), familial status, religion, national origin, and disability.   Some local ordinances [e.g., Portland and Eugene] protect against discrimination based upon age and sexual orientation.) 

As such, and as an initial matter, landlords should avoid asking any questions of RV rental applicants related to these prohibited areas.  The sole exception may be the age of a potential applicant if the RV section qualifies as a “55 or older” facility under the Federal Fair Housing Act.  The qualifications for “55 or older” housing are very strict and you should always check with your attorney before asking age-related questions on your rental application.  

During an RV tenancy, landlords must also be careful to avoid anything that might be interpreted as discriminatory. For example, rent increases should typically be made across the board to avoid discrimination allegations.  Another thing to avoid is the uneven enforcement of your rules and regulations.  Every RV tenant should be held equally accountable to follow the rules, and appropriate notices should be issued to every tenant who violates the rules to leave no room for any discrimination claims.
 
Reasonable Accommodation

The Fair Housing Act also prohibits acts that “discriminate against any person… in the provision of services or facilities in connection with [a] dwelling, because of a handicap of that person or any person associated with that person.”  The FHA defines discrimination as “a refusal to make reasonable accommodation in its rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a [disabled] person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.”  The FHA obligates landlords to make “reasonable accommodations” in the “rules, policies, practices, or services,” necessary to afford handicapped persons “equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.”

This means that if an RV tenant requests an “accommodation” for his or her handicap, the landlord is obligated to provide it unless it causes a financial or administrative burden.  A typical example might be if a handicapped RV tenant requested an RV rental space closest to the park’s RV restrooms/showers.  In most cases, the landlord would need to accommodate this request if it were possible to accommodate the request without causing a “burden.”

However, landlords need not provide housing to individuals whose “tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.”  A good example of this would be if an RV tenant requested to keep a pit bull as a “companion animal.”  In most instances, the landlord would be justified in rejecting this request since pit bulls are generally considered a dangerous breed.
