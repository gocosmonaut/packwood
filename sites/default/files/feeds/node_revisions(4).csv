"218","218","3","Phil Querin Q&A   Resident Couple Divorces - One Moves Out - How to Document","<p>Question:  A few years ago, a married couple originally applied together for residency in our community.  Based on their combined credit scores, they were both approved for residency.  They have since divorced and one of them has moved out.  How do we deal with this?</p>
<p>We have several questions listed below. Answer:  First, please understand that Oregon law does not directly deal with this – and neither is it addressed in most rental/lease agreements, including MHCO’s.  So my responses are based upon my opinion alone.  Until an appellate court rules on these issues – which is unlikely, since most such cases are never appealed - the best we can do is speculate. My answers are in italics below.</p>
<p>1. Do we write a new lease for the remaining resident or keep the old lease with both residents on the lease?</p>
<p><em>I think I would prefer to see a new lease signed by the remaining resident – even if title remains in both their names. That way, the ex-spouse cannot argue that he or she has a right of occupancy a year or two down the road, when they patch things up, or one moves out and the other moves back in.  A new lease would require than any new occupants be qualified all over again. Note that if the lease is changed into the name of the remaining resident, the ex-spouse would certainly have no liability for space rent going forward.</em></p>
<p>2. Can we legally keep the resident that moved out, responsible for the lease after a divorce and separation of assets?</p>
<p><em>Technically, yes.  Neither the divorce decree nor the parties themselves can – without your consent – alter their joint legal duties under a lease they both signed.  [This situation is not dissimilar to spouses jointly signing their mortgage and then divorcing; they both remain liable under the mortgage, even though one vacates the home.] The best a divorce court can do is to make the occupying ex-spouse primarily responsible for the rent and give indemnity rights to the non-occupying ex-spouse in case she or he end up having to pay for unpaid rent that should have been paid by the occupying ex-spouse.</em></p>
<p>3. Do we rescreen the remaining resident to see if he/she qualifies on their own?</p>
<p><em>I have a visceral reaction to doing so – if they did not pass the credit requirements, then what?  Deny them the right to stay in the community in which they have lived for a number of years?  Kick them out without waiting to see whether they can – or will make the payments?  That is like punishing the remaining ex-spouse for being divorced.  Remember, the occupying ex-spouse will likely be the custodial parent, if children are involved.  The non-custodial parent will likely have some child support obligation, which would then make the custodial parent’s individual credit score less important.   The same may be said even if there are no children; there may be a spousal support obligation by the non-occupying ex-spouse.  It seems to me that it will become clear soon enough, whether the occupying ex-spouse can or will make the space rental payments, independent of what their current credit score may be.</em></p>
<p>4. If we do rescreen the remaining resident and he/she fails the credit or criminal background, what are our options?</p>
<p><em>Before you re-screen, re-read my answer to Question No. 3 above.  If the lease agreement or rules do not address the possibility of spouses divorcing – and I have never seen any that do – the ultimate decision on whether you may re-screen could be left up to a judge.  I submit that judges do not like to evict people out of their homes unless there is a compelling reason to do so.  A case in which a resident is being evicted for no reason other than that they no longer meet the credit criteria – with no evidence that they are in default under the lease or rules – would be a very difficult sell to most judges.  It is unlikely that you would prevail.  I compare this situation to requiring a resident to be re-screened upon a job loss or death of a spouse. In cases of such unplanned events occurring after residents have been approved, I suggest that you let the situation play itself out.  If a resident cannot afford to pay the space rent, you will then have sufficient cause to evict.  But to try to evict because you doubt the ability of the resident to pay rent in the future, is premature and likely to fail. </em></p>
<p><em></em> 5. Who owns the security deposit or pre-paid rent?</p>
<p><em>That depends upon whether you have the remaining resident sign a new lease. If a new lease is signed, you could issue a refund check to both of them under the first least, and require the remaining occupant to pay a new deposit under the new lease.  It would be preferable, however, to see if they could agree to authorize you to leave the existing deposit in place, but permitting you to refund it, if appropriate, to the remaining occupant at the end of his/her tenancy.  If no agreement can be reached, simply hold the deposit until expiration of the tenancy by the occupying non-spouse, and then, if a refund is in order, make the check out to both of them.</em></p>","<p>Question:  A few years ago, a married couple originally applied together for residency in our community.

"33","33","1","The Tenant Application and Screening Process by Phil Querin","<p>Generally  The tenant application process is one of the least understood by landlords and managers.  This lack of familiarity can result in significant liability to park owners.  The purpose of this article is to set forth the applicable laws governing the process, and discuss some tips and traps that may be useful when certain issues and problems arise.</p><p>Screening Criteria The manufactured housing section of Oregon's landlord-tenant law provides that ""Any conditions the landlord applies in approving a purchaser...as a tenant in the event the tenant elects to sell the home"" should be disclosed in the rental or lease agreement.""[1] Although those conditions must be in conformance with state and federal laws, there are no limitations or restrictions as to what may be placed in the rental or lease agreement.</p><p>MHCO's rental and lease agreement forms[2] contain a number of criteria that landlords may impose, such as:  (a) prior rental references; (b) unsatisfactory credit history or no credit history; (c) character references; (d) criminal history; (e) insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly space rent and other expense obligations imposed by the rental or lease agreement; (f) the presence, number and size of pets; (g) age verification criteria if the park is a 55+ facility; (h) evidence of falsified or misleading material information; (i) refusal to sign a written lease or rental agreement; (j) additional occupants; and (k) adverse public record information.</p><p>Although there may be other criteria that landlords may wish to use when deciding whether to accept an applicant as a tenant, the above list is very comprehensive, and should be sufficient in imposing adequate guidelines when a tenant wishes to sell their home on site.  MHCO additionally has an application form which solicits this and other information from prospective tenants.</p><p>Landlords and managers should become familiar with the criteria imposed in their rental agreements and rental application forms.  Additionally, they should not rely upon the application information submitted to them without a thorough background check that provides the necessary verification.  Although Oregon law imposes a 7-day period within which landlords have to respond to a submitted application, it does not prohibit landlords from imposing a longer period so long as the applicant agrees.  Additionally, Oregon law expressly states that the 7-day period does not commence if the application is incomplete or inaccurate.  Accordingly, landlords and managers would be wise to immediately return any submitted</p><p>application if it is incomplete – and upon discovering that the prospective tenant/purchaser provided inaccurate information, the application should also be returned.  Accepting an incomplete application or continuing with the process after discovering that the applicant has provided bad information can result in an argument by the existing tenant or the new applicant that the landlord is intentionally delaying the process.</p><p>It is also important to note that Oregon law permits the ""...landlord and the prospective purchaser (to) agree to a longer time period for the landlord to evaluate the prospective purchaser's application or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord's screening or admission criteria.""  Thus, as noted on the MHCO Application form, there is a place for the landlord to insert a period longer than the statutory seven day period.  If the landlord suspects any delay, either on the applicant's part or his own part, a longer period should be inserted.  If the applicant rejects this extension, then the landlord can decide whether he wants to proceed to process the application at all.</p><p>Note: If a tenant has not previously given the landlord the 10 days' advance notice of intent to sell as required in ORS 90.680(4) (a), the landlord's seven day response time is extended to 10 days.  But remember, in no instances does the landlord have to receipt and process an inaccurate or incomplete application.  It is better not to accept a defective application – or return it immediately upon finding that it is inaccurate or incomplete, than continuing to process it.</p><p>If a landlord requires a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser the application the landlord shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale. It is important to remember that the terms of these park document given to the prospective tenant need not be the same as those in the existing (i.e. selling) tenant's documents.[3]</p><p>Park Documents  Landlords and managers should always remember that when they change one of the park documents, they may have to change others. This is because of two risks: (a) The failure to incorporate a change in the lease, say, into the Statement of Policy, and (b) An inconsistency between one or more of the park documents, such as the rental agreement and the rules.  Rules can generally be changed in the middle of a tenancy, but rental agreements cannot.  So landlords should remember to make sure their documents are all internally consistent.</p><p>Fair Housing Laws  The state and federal fair housing laws are essentially – but not completely – the same.  Landlords and managers should familiarize themselves with any special ordinances found in their city or county laws.  However, Oregon law prohibits any form of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing when directed at the following protected classes: ""...race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status or source of income.""[4]  The easiest, best, and safest way to deal with the risk of a discrimination claim is to make all screening criteria facially neutral.  Do not have rules which – even unintentionally - could have a negative impact on a member of a protected class.</p><p>In Oregon, most claims of discrimination relate to familial status.  Examples range from managers encouraging families to purchase and reside in one particular area of the community (where there are more children), to making off-hand comments to applicants (e.g. ""there would be very few children for your kids to play with here"") that may be construed as indicating a desire not to rent to people with children.  For this reason, landlords and managers should strive to apply their screening criteria neutrally regardless of the applicant's membership in a protected class.</p><p>Additionally, caution should be exercised in answering questions over the phone, since federal and state ""testers"" have been known to test parks by making multiple phone calls asking various loaded questions, such as ""Is this a good place to raise my children?""  If the community is a family park, the best response to open-ended telephone inquiries is to tell the caller that it is a family park, open to all, and that they are welcome to come in and pick up an application for processing.</p><p>One of the biggest areas of concern for landlords and managers today involve issues of immigration status.  At the risk of minimizing the problem, there is one basic rule that landlords and managers should always remember when screening applicants.  While it is not a ""silver bullet,"" it should help avoid the vast majority of issues regarding immigration status.  Never treat any single applicant differently from another.  This means that landlords should not automatically ""suspect"" that certain persons are illegally in this country and then impose more rigorous screening criteria on them alone.  It is best not to ask about immigration status.[5]  If the applicant passes the same screening criteria imposed upon others, and all of the information in their application checks out, you should accept the current applicant, regardless of whether you have suspicions about their immigration status. One of the frequently asked questions is whether a landlord may insist that applicants provide their social security number.  While this is not automatically illegal, it can be when applied to some applicants and not others.  Consistency is the name of the game.  Do not request verification in some cases and not others.  Do not accept some tenants who fail to provide the number, but accept others (who are not obviously immigrants) without also providing such proof.</p><p>Another area of concern is occupancy limits or extra occupancy charges.[6]  This is somewhat of a grey area because Oregon law currently permits a two person per bedroom rule – assuming that it is expressly listed as part of the park's screening criteria and uniformly applied.  However, the problem is that federal law contains no specific occupancy limits.  This means that, in theory, one could be in compliance with state law, while violating federal law.  For example, if a family consisted of two adults and three children who owned a 2-bedroom home, a ""2-persons per bedroom"" requirement would mean that they could not move into the park.  But if the third child was an infant who slept in the parents' room, one may ask whether this standard is reasonable, even though it complies with Oregon law.  At the risk of violating federal law, which imposes no such occupancy limits, the better approach might be to avoid the ""slippery slope"" problem entirely, by not creating occupancy limits.[7]</p><p>Perhaps the most difficult of screening criteria issues is in the area of assistance animals.  Since handicap is a protected class, this means that if one could establish a legitimate need for an assistance animal they could not be prevented from having one – even though the park might have a one-pet policy and this might be their second pet.  This could be so even though the animal was not trained or certified in providing assistance.  MHCO has Form 15 that may be given to tenants applying for a ""reasonable accommodation"" which is the technical term used when an allegedly handicapped person requests relief from strict application of a rule that interferes with their handicapped. [8] As most landlords and managers know, the handicap protections can be severely stretched.  There are many reasons for this, including, among other things, the handicap may be allegedly psychological, and the tenant has nothing more than a note from a doctor – not a treating psychologist or psychiatrist.</p><p>The other difficult issue is that assistant animals are not technically ""pets"" and therefore are not subject to the requirement that the Pet Agreement be completed.  Ultimately it comes down to a rule of reason and proof.  Does it appear that the person requesting the accommodation is legitimately handicapped? Do they have a known history of the handicap – that is, has it ever come up before?  Does it appear that the claim of a handicap is new, and possibly raised as a pretext, say to circumvent a one-pet policy?</p><p>Ultimately, the issue comes down to public safety in the community.  For example, if the tenant wanted to have a pit bull (in violation of a dangerous breed prohibition) or a bull-mastiff (in violation of a size restriction), the landlord should ask which battle he or she wants to fight?  If the tenant isn't credible, has a history of skirting the rules on this or other issues, it might make sense to refuse and let them take the next step.  If they bring the animal into the park in light of the denial, you will have a choice; either do nothing or send out a notice of violation which would require removal of the animal.  The risk in allowing dangerous or oversized breed into the park is that it may harm someone, and then the landlord will have to defend a lawsuit for failing to enforce their own rules.  Additionally, in consenting, the precedent has been set, now permitting such animals based upon a tenant's assertion the need it for assistance.  Remember, ""reasonable accommodations"" need only be ""reasonable.""  Dogs with vicious propensities or who pose danger to children because of their size, are not the only type of assistance animals available.</p><p>Marijuana cards raise the same issue, although perhaps even worse, since the cards seem to be freely given to almost anyone.  In some cases, however, this too can be dealt with on another level. If the persons with medical marijuana cards have an inordinate amount of traffic at their home throughout the day and night, perhaps the issue is one for the police, since it is still illegal to sell or distribute marijuana, medical or otherwise.  If they are dealing in the illegal drug, careful (documented) scrutiny of these comings and goings might prove useful.</p><p>Miscellaneous Screening and Application Issues Occasionally, tenants apply for occupancy even though they cannot afford to purchase the home on their own, and perhaps would not qualify under the financial criteria imposed for acceptance into the park.  However, they may have a parent or other person willing to assist in the purchase and willing to guarantee the applicant's performance.  There is nothing wrong with this approach, assuming that the guarantor passes all of the financial criteria the park would impose.  First, remember that the guarantor will not be living in the home – they may have their own housing requirements that impose financial limitations on them.  If the tenant defaults, can the guarantor actually afford to pay the space rent?  Under such cases, the financial criteria applied to co-signers should be more rigorous than those imposed on tenant applicants.  Secondly, landlords should be sure to have their attorney draft a solid guarantee agreement that gives them the right to seek payment against the guarantor without having to first evict the tenant.  Third, before accepting a co-signer, a landlord should ask whether they have a sufficiently significant relationship with the applicant such that they will actually be willing to subsidize the space rent if it is not paid.</p><p>A fundamental problem in the tenant screening process is the denial process.  Landlords must be prompt in informing applicants if their application is denied.  Obviously, a denial can provoke an angry response.  Landlords need to be proactive.  MHCO has two forms to address the issue, so that the landlord or manager does not have to engage in any more explanation than that provided in the form.  MHCO Form 10, identifies the source of the material or information resulting in the turn down.  That is all the landlord is required to do, unless it comes from a credit reporting agency. In that case, MHCO's Form 10A should be given so that applicant has the ability to know which credit company was involved and track down the source of the information.</p><p>It is due to financial issues that many applicants get turned down.  Especially today. For that reason, MHCO has developed the ""Straight Talk"" form, describing manufactured home living and affordability issues.  It should be used in all cases, if possible.</p><p>Although we discussed the Statement of Policy (""SOP"") above, there are two additional points to be made: (a) Always be sure to obtain a receipt (MHCO Form 7C), since it is proof positive that the resident received the SOP and the Rules and Rental or Lease Agreement.  Without the receipt, the tenant can deny receiving it, and the burden of proof to establish delivery is on the landlord.  This can be a difficult task unless witnesses were present who can verify delivery.  (b) The second item to note is use of the Rent History attachment to the SOP a copy of the Rent History (Form 7A).  This permits the tenant to see the monthly base rent for each of the five years preceding the current year of tenancy.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important (and newest) forms if not used, is the Flood Plain Notice (MHCO Form 6).  It notifies those residents whose homes are located in all or part of a 100-year floodplain.  This means that landlords and/or their managers, should look at a current FEMA map to determine whether all or a portion of their park is located inside such a plain.  If so, those residents whose spaces are in the floodplain should be notified.  While technically, being located in a 100-year floodplain means that flood water levels are statistically expected to flood onto the plain once every 100 years, most people realize that over the course of 100 years, there could be three or more such floods or none at all.  The MHCO form, in compliance with Oregon statute, suggests to those receiving the notice that they consider obtaining flood insurance.  The good news is that once having given this notice, a landlord is not liable for any uninsured water loss suffered by the resident due to a flood; the bad news is that failing to give the notice can subject the landlord to the lesser of two months' rent or the resident's actual damages, whichever is less.</p><p>Conclusion  Landlords would have fewer tenant problems if they took more time during the screening process. This means resisting the temptation to fill a space quicker than the approval process actually takes.  Unfortunately, the desire to have the rental flow commence quickly sometimes results in the process becoming rushed.  And landlords and managers should never allow the applicant to rush them.  Nor should they ever permit an applicant to move into a home before the process has been completed and a new rental agreement signed.  Lastly, fairness and uniformity in screening will help to avoid the ever-present liability that can occur under the federal and state Fair Housing laws.</p><p>©Copyright 2010 by Phillip C. Querin.

This creates the appearance that questions regarding immigration status are reserved for Latinos or those from other Central American countries.  National origin is a constitutionally protected class.  As a result, this type of selective screening creates (in legal terms) a ""disparate impact"" on folks from Mexico and Central America, and can therefore be found to be a violation of the Fair Housing laws.</p><p>[6] Occupancy limits are sometimes used as ""tools"" by landlords to impose restrictions on persons with larger families, and therefore poses a potential violation of the familial status protected status.

"36","36","1","Rental Application Process","<p>As a community manager, you will normally be charged with accepting or rejecting prospective residents.  This is one of the most important functions that you will perform as a manager of a manufactured home community.  Done properly and effectively, the rental application and screening process will minimize potential problems in landlord – resident relations.  If the process is done incorrectly the seeds of future problems will be sown.  Every prospective resident should be given sufficient information to make an informed decision about living in a manufactured home community.</p><p>When an individual stops by the manufactured home community office inquiring on the possibility of becoming a resident, always give them an application packet.

Let's not forget that the requirements also mandate the re-survey.</p><p>What do the Regulations say?  ""...The procedures described in paragraph (b) [routinely determining the occupancy of each unit, including the identification of whether at least one occupant of each unit is 55 years of age or older] ... must provide for regular updates, through surveys or other means, of the initial information supplied by the occupants of the housing facility or community.  Such updates must take place once every two years ....""</p><p>For example, there were objections to the re-survey mandate on the grounds it was too burdensome.  HUD stated that owners would not be unduly burdened by the update requirements since the information ""will be readily available in the files.""</p><p>This comment reflects that the survey requirement can be fulfilled by preparation of a summary of names and ages of the homeowners based on existing file information (assuming the files are up to date).  One might annotate a rent roll with resident ages and satisfy the requirement.  HUD emphasizes that ""...the re-survey does not require that all supporting documents be collected again – only that the community confirm that those persons counted as occupying dwellings for purposes of meeting the 80% requirement are, in fact, still in occupancy.""</p><p>It is also clear that the survey is a ""summary"" and not required to include underlying documentation (remember the POA must be obtained for approval of tenancy and kept in the resident's file): ""[Only the overall survey summary is required to be available for review, not the supporting documentation.  The word 'summary' has been added to this section"").</p><h2>Compilation of the ""Summary""</h2><p>In review of the files to compile the required ""summary,"" it is possible that some files may be missing POA (Proof of Age) documentation.  Missing POA reflects inconsistent conformance to a required age verification policy.  This can be fatal to defending a ""55+"" status.  Yet, there are plausible reasons why POA may be absent.  Perhaps a resident's tenancy commenced before the date of enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (September 12, 1988): this was the last date to ""grandfather"" underage residents excluded from the calculation of the 80-20 requirement; perhaps the Xerox copier did not work on the day identification was checked; perhaps the applicant's age was so obvious that documentation was overlooked; perhaps the POA was misplaced.  None of these explanations will ""wash"" with fair housing enforcers.  Now is the time for review of this information.  Supplementing resident files may bolster a defense of the ""55+"" status by proving the 80-20 ratio, but cannot substitute for consistent conformance to a policy of seeking POA documentation.  HUD's requirements are crystal clear: ""The housing facility or community must establish and maintain appropriate policies to require that occupants comply with the age verification procedures required by this section.""</p><h2>Should you seek missing POA information?</h2><p>Yes.  In a large scale review of resident files by fair housing enforcers, the main objective for review of proof of age may be to establish the 80-20 ratio: Proof of age in the file may itself be seen as evidence of adherence to collection of required data:  even after-acquired information reflects, at least, compliance with the 2-year survey requirement.  Proof of age includes</p><p>the following: driver's license (an expired or out-of-state license seems 'ok'), birth certificate, passport, immigration card, military identification, any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of ""comparable reliability.""  This may include birth certificates, baptismal or marriage documents, perhaps, and other public records.</p><h2>What if the tenant refuses to provide proof of age?</h2><p>New purchaser:  Of course, refusal to supply proof of age when applying for tenancy is a basis for denying a tenancy application.  The regulations also allow for a declaration from a member of the household over 18 years of age, stating that at least one person in the homesite is at least 55 years of age.  This after-acquired information is permissible for the survey, but again does not bolster evidence of conformance to proof of age documentation required for tenancy approval.</p><p>HUD provides a skeletal sample of certification.  This can also be used as part of the tenancy application alone or better yet as a backup to production of proof of age.  The sample reads as follows: ""I, (name), am 18 years of age or older and a member of the household that resides at (housing facility or community), (unit number or designation).  I hereby certify that I have personal knowledge of the ages of the occupants of this household and that at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older.""  Actual proof of age should be obtained at the application stage to avoid false reporting – no defense to a failure to achieve the 80-20 ration.</p><p>The regs also allow for other proof of age if an existing resident refuses to provide it.  HUD states that ""[I]f the occupants ... refuse to comply with the age verification procedures, the [management] may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.  Such evidence may include: (1) Government records or documents, such as a local household census; (2) Prior forms or applications; or (3) A statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants.  The individual's statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge and be signed under the penalty of perjury.""</p><p>Thus, the survey could be supplemented by including a sworn declaration or affidavit by any person with personal knowledge of the age of the resident's age.  In past cases where proof of age was critically important, private investigation of public records to obtain that information has been conducted to provide such knowledge.  Remember however, that obtaining proof of age ""after the fact"" shows compliance with the 2-year survey requirement, but does not substitute for a consistent practice of securing the required information at the time of processing the tenancy application.</p><p>HUD gives the following example as acceptable: ""the owner of a mobile home park where the residents own the coach but rent the land requires a statement of whether at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older before any sublease or new rental.""  In other words, the qualification procedure can be instituted within the application process itself.  HUD states such an example (""All new leases, new purchase agreements, or new applications contain a provision directly above the signatory line for leases, asserting that at least one occupant or the swelling will be 55 years of age or older.  In addition the community surveys all current residents for their occupancy status in compliance with the 55–or-older requirements"").  Actual proof of age should always be required with submission of the tenancy application as well.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The continuing survey requirement is mandatory.  Whether failure to comply will be fatal to the assertion of ""older persons"" status is unknown, but this survey requirement is part of the ""intent"" prong of operating an ""older persons"" community.  In sum, it is time to compile the summary for your park.</p><p>(Reprinted with permission from MHI)</p><h2>Do you operate a 55 &amp; Older Community?</h2><h2>Do you have the necessary MHCO Forms for 55 &amp; Older Communities?</h2><h2>MHCO has the Resources You Need!</h2><p>If you are one of the many members of MHCO who own and operate a 55 &amp; Older manufactured home community - MHCO has the resources you need to keep that community compliant with current HUD rules.</p><ul><li>Addendum      to the Rent/Lease Agreement for Age 55 &amp; Older Communities (MHCO Form      71A)</li><li>55      &amp; Older Community - Occupation Determination and Age Verification      (MHCO Form 71B)</li><li>55      &amp; Older Community HUD Verification of Occupancy Survey (MHCO Form 71C)</li></ul><p>These are excellent tools to use in the effective management of your 55 &amp; Older community.

"41","41","1","Revisiting Rules and Regulations in All-age Communities:   Unenforceable Rules Trumped by Familial Status Rights","<p><strong>By Terry R. Dowdall, Esq.</strong></p><p>The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 created a new protected class of ""familial status.""  In California, the federal courts have addressed these requirements by ruling that ""all age"" communities may not discriminate against children, no more than management can discriminate against any other protected class.  This article is addressed to the need for continuing concerns over rule and regulation content and enforcement.  This guidance comes from a case brought against Plaza Mobile Estates, defended by this office.</p><h2><strong>The FHAA</strong></h2><p>In 1988, Congress amended the Fair Housing Act (FHA) to prohibit not just discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, disability, or national origin, but also included familial status discrimination.  Familial status is defined as "" one or more individuals (who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with ... a parent or another person having legal custody of such individual  or individuals.""</p><p>Among other provisions, it is unlawful:</p><p><em>""To discriminate against any persons in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of ... familial status ...""</em></p><p>Thus, a restriction on access or use of common facilities and amenities bases on age of a child (familial status) is a violation of the FHAA, absent compelling business necessity.  Any such rule must be proved to be the least restrictive means to achieving a health and safety justification.  What does this legalese mean to the community owner in practical terms?  A full-blown trial, risks of heavy penalties, damages, and attorney's fees and costs.  This is because there is no bright line test for any age-restrictive regulation:  the law is bereft of any standards or guidance to make a reasonable, predictable risk-assessment or likelihood of success.  Each case depends on the facts and surrounding circumstances.  In other words, each case is a test-case.  In sum, the penalties are so severe that prudent counsel would admonish all to eliminate age-restrictive rules and regulations.</p><p>Children are as protected as any other protected class.  Thus, a simple way to test a rule for FHA compliance is this: insert any other protected class in the place of ""children"" when testing a rule and regulation.  For example, a common past rule (and no longer a valid one) is ""all children under 14 years of age must be accompanied by an adult resident when in the pool area.""  Then, how does this sound:  ""All Methodists must be accompanied by an adult resident ....""  Obviously, such a rule is patently violative of the FHA.</p><p>It is also a violation of the FHAA to express to agents, brokers, employees, prospective sellers, or renters a preference, (e.g. ""... gosh, if I had my druthers, I would rather not rent to families"").  Another issue is use of selective advertisements, or denying information about housing opportunities to particular segments of the housing market because of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or</p><p>national origin, (example, in an area overwhelmingly populated by non-English speakers, advertising only in English language publications).  Other violations will be found where there are ads or statements made regarding applicants, including: ""mature person;"" stating an aversion to ""families with children"" or ""teenagers in the building;"" advertisements stating non more than ""one child;"" or, stating that the community owner does not ""rent to children.""  Posting ""Adult Community: at the entrance to a non-exempt community also violates the FHAA.  Use of the word ""adult"" without more, constitutes a violation of the FHAA.  There are no such thins as adult manufactured home communities, and use of the phrase is deemed to chill family applicants from applying for tenancy in them.</p><p><em>The various rules cited by the courts as impermissibly restricting access or denying the use of the communities' facilities and/or areas on the basis of age, included the following.  If your rules contain any of the following restrictions, or any rules similar to them, it is <strong>strongly advised</strong> that a legal advisor conversant with the FHAA (and implanting regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations) be promptly consulted.</em></p><ul><li>Children under the age of fourteen      (14) years old shall not be allowed to ride a bicycle on the community      streets without the accompaniment of an adult registered to the      manufactured home in which they reside;</li><li>Children under the age of eight      (8) years old must be confined to a play area in the rear fenced yard of      the family residence;</li><li>Children shall not be allowed to      play on community streets, or in any other common are areas; Residents under the age of      eighteen (18) years old shall not be permitted to use the recreation      building (clubhouse) or any other recreational facilities without the      accompaniment of an adult registered to the manufactured home in which      they reside;</li><li>Residents under the age of      eighteen (18) years old must be accompanied by the registered resident      adult from the same household in order to use any of the recreational      facilities or recreational building (clubhouse);</li><li>Residents and visitors under the age      of eighteen (18) years old may use the swimming pool and sun deck during      the hours of 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. (noon) every day.

Having held that these rules were unlawful, the issues remaining for trial in the Plaza Mobile Estates case included damages, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs for the private plaintiffs.</p><p>While the action had been brought as a class claim (in which all of possibly thousands of affected residents could have been included in damages awards), class certification efforts were defeated, allowing only the named parties to seek damages.</p><p>The court's comments regarding the invalidation of these rules is telling and troubling.  The court stated the age-restrictive rules were facially discriminatory.  In other words, no matter how administered, the rules were invalid as drafted.  Even if never enforced , such rules might dissuade a prospective applicant from applying for tenancy.  These rules ""...treat children, and thus, families with children differently and less favorably than adults-only households.""  ""Describ[ing] parks as 'adult' parks are clear examples of illegal steering.  Although they are not outright refusals to sell or rent or families with children, they indicate a preference for adults only and certainly discourage families with children from applying.""</p><p>Considering the various age restrictive rules, they fall into three categories: (1) absolute prohibitions, (2) adult supervision requirements, and (3) hours of access restrictions.</p><h2><strong>Absolute prohibitions</strong></h2><p>The absolute prohibitions include those rules that (1) prohibit all children under 18 (or 21) years old from using the billiard room and from riding bicycles, (2) prohibit all children under 16 (or 18) years old from using the therapeutic pool, (3) prohibit all children under 14 (or 18) years old from using the sauna or Jacuzzi, (4) require all children under 8 years old to be confined to rear fenced yard of family residence, and (5) prohibit all children from playing on community streets and any other common areas.</p><p>The court held that absolute prohibitions such as the foregoing are illegal.  The regulations are not the least restrictive means to achieve health and safety objectives (""...prohibiting all 'children' from playing in common areas ... cannot be justified"").  The same applies with the billiard room (""... it is unclear how a 17-year-old's access to a billiard room is any more hazardous to ... health or safety that a 22-year-old's access"").</p><h2><strong>Supervision restrictions</strong></h2><p>The fundamental premise adopted by the court is that ""[A]ny concerns that defendants may have are not necessarily linked to age, and any concerns about problem behavior can be address with the use of rules.""  Thus, the court invalidated blanket prohibitions of all 15-year-olds from using the therapeutic pool and all 13-year-olds from using the sauna or Jacuzzi</p><p>In certain instances adult supervision might less restrictively advance health and safety concerns (""assuming arguendo that defendants' concerns were more logically linked to the age restrictions, requiring adult supervision rather than imposing an absolute ban is clearly a less restrictive means ..."").  But where to set the limit is uncertain.  California regulations state:</p><p>""Where no lifeguard service is provided, a warning sign shall be placed in plain view and shall state 'Warning – No Lifeguard on Duty' with clearly legible letters at least 10.2 centimeters (4 inches) high.  In addition, the sign shall also state 'Children Under the Age of 14 Should not Use Pool Without an Adult in Attendance.""</p><p>Based on the Plaza Mobile Estates decision, it is needlessly legally risky to impose any supervision requirement.  Clearly, a 14 year age limit for an adult supervision is not enforceable, not legal, and constitutes a violation of the FHA, despite former administrative decisions suggesting the contrary and California regulations cited above.  Yet, the need for an age limit is strikingly clear.  The same rule applies to use of spas and whirlpools.  Certainly an adult supervision requirement should be reasonable[1], but eh court has ruled that such concerns are fro the parents, not the management.</p><h2><strong>A few apparently unassailable precepts</strong></h2><p>Given that this case raises many more questions than it answers, the ability to promulgate and rely on age-restrictive rules for access and supervision are certainly less than a matter of clarity.  While the previous rulings concerning the enforceability of age-restrictive rules are in some doubt, a few precepts can be stated with some reliability.  The first is that an outright prohibition of use or access to any facility or amenity cannot be allowed.  Setting up selected hours for usage of a facility of amenity cannot be allowed.  Less certain is the ability to promulgate rules requiring adult supervision of children of varying ages for use of facilities or amenities.  It would appear that no supervision can be mandated for areas such as clubhouse, billiard room, library or common areas.</p><h2><strong>Establishing minimum age requirements for supervision:  A foray into the uncertain</strong></h2><p>The ""14 and under"" requirement of California regulations for pool supervision is a should not a must provision.  Hence, management cannot require supervision of 14 years of age and under.  The only clearly legal position is not to require supervision, and let it be for the parents to take personal accountability and responsibility for their children.  The court makes this statement:</p><p>""... there is nothing magical about the age 18 or 14 years old if defendants' concerns are for the protection of the health and safety of the children or other residents in using recreational facilities or the swimming pool or riding bicycles.  Such concerns could be addressed with the use of rules.  Moreover, rather than being connected to such ages, bicycle and pool safety would be better served with a proficiency requirement.""</p><p>The courts have intervened on occasion to require discrimination against children for their own good and government does so all the time.  For example, you cannot vote until you are 18, drink alcohol until you are 21, cannot drive until you are 16.[2]  However, housing providers subject to the FHA may not rely on or use the same governmentally-established restrictions in developing their rules and regulations despite the dangers posed by the common area facilities.</p><p>Another example:  Pedestrian injuries are the second greatest cause of harm to children from five to 14 years of age.  See the National Safe Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997.[3]  However, it is illegal to have a rule and regulations which states that ""children are not to walk around the community without adult supervision.""</p><p>Is it unreasonable to require adult supervision within the common areas of a manufactured home community?  It would seem that such a rule is reasonable.  However, for a community owner, such a rule violates the FHA.  On the other hand the Consumer Products safety Commission urges supervision of children while on a playground for example (Consumer Product Safety Commission, Public Playground Safety Checklist, CPSC Document #327: ""10. Carefully supervised children on playgrounds to make sure they're safe"").  The federal law states that the parents are responsible for their children, not the management.</p><h2><strong>Previously sustained rules</strong></h2><p>The courts have previously allowed the following rules.  This information may be largely historical at this juncture, for it remains unclear whether or not they remain viable in light of the Plaza Mobile Estates decision (these rules were sustained under the previous ""reasonableness"" test, not the ""compelling interest"" basis test):</p><ol><li>Rules which bar use of a pool for      children fourteen (14) years of age and less have been upheld because the      prohibition implements legislative policy.

Town Hall Terrace Association, 1997 WL 128353 (W.D.N.Y.      1997), the housing provider made available four pieces of exercise      equipment: a multi-purpose with lifting machine, a stationary bicycle, an      inclining board and a rowing machine – in its ""the fitness center.""  Until 1992 an express policy restricted      the use of the fitness center and its equipment to persons at least      eighteen (18) years old.  After      mid-1992, this threshold was lowered to sixteen (16).[4]</li><li>One case allowed for a rule      requiring adult supervision of children six (6) and under while biking in      a street.  U.S. v. M. Westland Co.,      CV 93-4141, Fair Housing-Fair Lending 15,941 (HUD ALJ 1994)).  Another authority states that no child      should be permitted in a street on a bicycle until at least ten (10) years      of age.  (""Cycling should be      restricted to sidewalks and paths until a child is age 10 and able to show      how well he or she rides and observes the basic rules of the road.  Parental and adult supervision is      essential and until the traffic skills and judgment thresholds are reached      by each child.""  The National Safe      Kids Campaign Bicycle Injury Fact Sheet, September, 1997).</li></ol><p>But under the more recent Plaza Mobile Estates decision, the past allowances provide no basis on which to write your rules and regulations.</p><h2><strong>Don't blame the court!</strong></h2><p>However, it is too much to criticize or impugn the court for adhering to the letter of the law, and not legislating by ""judicial fiat.""  The court interprets what the law is and does not legislate.  That is the job of Congress and more pointedly in this case HUD (in its rule-making powers).  The FHA prohibits discrimination, period.  The federal law makes NO exceptions; exceptions to familial status rights is the job of HUD.  It is not the court's duty.  The court is not the Legislature.</p><h2><strong>The need for uniform guidelines to inform the housing providers of permissible restrictions</strong></h2><p>HUD should provide guidance for housing providers and establish bright line tests for common sense age-restrictive rules.  HUD should defer to other legislative judgments made for child protection by allowing community owners to replicate existing laws in their rules and regulations.  Model regulations for protection of the young could be published.  HUD could establish a rule pre-approval procedure.</p><p>Community owners just want to comply with the law and provide reasonable requirements for protection of children.  But now, even experienced lawyers cannot intelligibly predict the enforceability of any age-restrictive rules.  At this time, attaining any ascribed legitimacy of a rule only follows after an expensive legal defense with a heavy burden of proof requiring compelling business necessity.  A conciliation agreement binds the complainant.  If another resident complains the next day, the conciliation agreement is worthless as a defense to the rule.  This is an inconceivably inefficient manner of testing rule validity.  The costs to business in such concerns vastly outweigh the benefit to be achieved.  The cost to the consumer in spreading the expense of this exercise could be largely obviated if the housing provider had some guidance in defining acceptable rules for promotion of health and safety.  The suggestion of administering proficiency tests is a null and void concept.  The liability for negligently administering such tests, seeking and paying for qualified testers, and then excluding the non-proficient residents will not be pursued by a single housing provider.</p><p>What can we do?  Even in the absence of specific rules, educational materials may help parents understand common risks associated with youth.  When educational information is provided as an adjunct to an activity rather than a rule restricting an activity, the chance of a claim of discriminatory preference is less likely to be made.  For example, when a community owner offers such educational material from organizations who seek better protection of children, (e.g., police departments, charitable organizations, etc.) the community owner is providing a service – disseminating information and facts – not discriminating against children.[5]</p><p>You may also consider consulting with HUD in advance of amending rules and regulations.  IF HUD even informally opines that a proposed policy is not defensible, or that no comment can be offered, at least the community owner can better assess the risk faced with a new rule and regulation.  For example, if a resident complains that a particular resident who has open sores due to infection with the AIDS virus desires to use the swimming pool, can the management require that resident to stay out of the pool?</p><p>When faced with the question, the manger called to advise that she was not sure how to proceed.  While administrative regulations require a doctor's letter stating that no public health or safety risk was posed by the patient's use of the pool, I consulted with HUD before announcing the management policy.</p><h2><strong>Finally</strong></h2><p>All the community owner wants is to know what the law is!  What we do know is certain rules, certain practices reflecting what the law is not.  But it is grossly unfair to relegate the duty to set standards on management.  Having read this article, can you now, safely amend your rules to impose such a rule?  No.  No attorney can give an absolute assurance that such a rule will be sustained until ruled valid in a court.  Until a court actually rules on the validity of the rule, or HUD or DFEH offers guidance on their interpretation of the rule, there can be no assurance of what an will not be permitted in developing age-restrictive rules and regulations.  The best policy is to eliminate any and all age restrictive rules and regulations to avoid FHA claims.</p><p><strong>Reprinted with permission from Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association (WMA) ""Reporter"", June 2008.</strong></p><p>Terry Dowdall has specialized in manufactured home communities' law since 1978.

Since 1980, CPSC has reports of more than 700 deaths in spas and hot tubs.  About one-third of those were drownings to children under age five.  Consumers should keep a locked safety cover on the spa whenever it is not in use and keep children away unless there is constant adult supervision.  Hot Tub Temperatures – CPSC knows of several deaths from extremely hot water (approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit) in a spa.  High temperatures can cause drowsiness which may lead to unconsciousness, resulting in drowning.  In addition, raised body temperature can lead to heat stroke and death.  In 1987, CPSC helped develop requirements for temperature controls to make sure that spa water temperatures never exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit.  Pregnant women and young children should not use a spa before consulting with a physician. ... ""CPSC Document #5112 ""Spas, Hot Tubs, and Whirlpools Safety Alert"".</p><p>[2] Municipal curfew regulations abound which restrict children.  Los Angeles is typical.  No one under 18 years of age is permitted in public places during school hours ("" ... present in or upon the public streets, ... or any place open to the public during the hours of 8:30 am and 1:30 pm"").  L.A.M.C. 45.04.  The same restrictions apply after 10 pm.  (""... any minor under the age of eighteen years to be present in or upon any public street, ... between the hours of 10:00 pm on any day and sunrise of the immediately following day; ....""). L.A.M.C. 45.03.  Regulations for pool halls E.g. 17 (Midland Mi. Mun. Code Sec. 15-34) and 18 (1063-B.  Pool halls.

It is unsafe for a park owner to rely on local or state laws in this respect in drafting rules and regulations.</p><p>[3] ""[P]edestrian injury is the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death among children ages 5 to 14.  While the majority of pedestrian deaths and injuries are traffic-related, children ages 0 to 2 are more likely to suffer non-traffic-related pedestrian injuries, including those occurring in driveways, parking lots or on sidewalks.  Although pedestrian injuries are not as common as motor vehicle occupant injuries, a disproportionate number of the injuries sustained by child pedestrians are severe.  Between 25 and 50 percent of child pedestrian injuries require hospital admission.  Children ages 5 to 9 are at the greatest risk from traffic–related pedestrian death and injury.  Nearly one-third of all children ages 5 to 9 who are killed in traffic crashes are pedestrians"").</p><p>[4] According to the U.S. Products Safety Commission: ""The U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that between 1985 and 1989, the latest period for which data are available, there were 1,200 amputations of children's fingers because of contact with exercise bikes.  Most children were under the age of five.  Many of the injuries occurred when the child's fingers touched the moving bike wheel or the chain and sprocket assembly.  The Commission is concerned about the severity of injuries to children, especially because the hazard may not be obvious.  Therefore, the commission warns parents always to keep children away from exercise bikes.  Never use a bike without a chain guard, and when not using the bike, store it where children cannot get to it.  Children's fingers can be amputated if they touch moving parts of exercise bike.""  Prevent Finger Amputations to Children From Exercise Bikes:  Safety Alert: CPSC Document #5028.</p><p>[5] For example, educational material exist which explain that young children have peripheral vision which is two-thirds that of  an adult; they have difficulty determining the source of sounds; traffic noises and sirens may be confusing; they may not understand that an automobile  may seriously hurt or kill them; most children cannot understand a complex chain of events; children believe that all grownups will look out for them; they think that if they can see an adult driving a car toward them, the driver must be able to see them; children often mix fantasy with reality – they may give themselves superhuman powers and o not understand that a moving vehicle can hurt them; they have difficulty judging the speed and distance of oncoming vehicles.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>","<p><strong>By Terry R.

These forms should be completed after you have reviewed the resident's application, and completed all background checks and tenant screening, but before the resident moves into their home.</p><p><strong>Copies of the following forms should be given to the new resident:</strong></p><ul><li>Copy of signed Rental Application</li><li>Copy of signed Rental Agreement signed by both manager and new resident</li><li>Copy of Park ""Rules and Regulations"" signed by the new resident</li><li>Copy RV Storage Agreement if applicable.</li><li>Copy of Pet Agreement if applicable</li><li>Copy of ""Statement of Policy"" signed by the new resident</li><li>Copy of Receipt of Statement of Policy</li><li>Copy of Rental History Addendum to Statement of Policy</li><li>Flood Plain Notice</li></ul><p><strong>The following documents should be in the new resident's office file:</strong></p><ul><li>Signed ""Reciept of Statement of Policy"" (signed before signing rental agreement)</li><li>Signed Rental Application</li><li>Signed Rental Agreement (signed by both manager and new resident)</li><li>Park ""Rules and Regulations"" signed by the new resident</li><li>Statement of Policy signed by the new resident</li><li>Rental History Addendum to Statement of Policy</li><li>Emergency Contact Information</li><li>RV Storage Agreement (if applicable)</li><li>Pet Agreement (if applicable) signed by the new resident</li><li>A copy of criminal, credit and rental checks.  Remember, credit check results <strong>are confidential</strong></li><li>Age verification (if 55 and Older Community)</li><li>Flood Plain Notice</li></ul><p>Remember – Prior to renting a space and permitting possession, you must have all proper inquiries completed and applicant accepted and the rental agreement signed.</p><p>If you are aware of a sale and do not have the purchaser fill out an application, or fail to advise the seller and prospective purchaser in writing that the application has been rejected within 7 days after they fill out the application, then the purchaser can move into the mobile home under the same condition of the rental agreement of the seller.  Basically, they assume the existing rental agreement you have with the seller of the manufactured home.</p><p>If a prospective tenant refuses to provide you with the necessary information for you to qualify them, then it is an automatic denial of the applicant.</p><p>It is important that an application is filled out and you check out the person carefully.  You should check them out the same as you do any prospective resident.  You do not have to approve the person just because they are buying an existing home in the park.  If they have a bad credit or rental history, they can be refused as a prospective tenant.  This does not necessarily kill the sale of the mobile home.  They can still purchase the home, they just cannot keep it in the park.  You need to provide a written rejection to both the seller and prospective purchaser within 7 days.  You need to advise them why they were not accepted.  If you denied them for credit reasons, give the applicant the name and phone number of the company who provided you with the report.  Advise the applicant that they can call them if they have any questions regarding the report.</p><p>It is important that you advise anyone that has a ""For Sale"" sign on their manufactured home that they do the three things listed at the beginning of this section.  Failure by the prospective resident to fill out an application or the landlord's failure to advise them that they do not qualify can be a very costly mistake in the event they move in and then you give them notice.  It makes for ill feelings for everyone involved.</p><p>If a resident sells their home and the new owner of the home has not filled out an application prior to moving into the home, you do not need to accept them as a resident.  You have no contract with them and you can request them to remove the home from the park.  <strong>DO NOT ALLOW PROSPECTIVE TENANTS TO MOVE IN BEFORE THE SCREENING PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLETED, AND THE APPLICANT HAS BEEN APPROVED AND SIGNED, AND RECEIPTED FOR THE STATEMENT OF POLICY, RULES AND REGULATIONS AND RENTAL AGREEMENT.  DO NOT ACCEPT RENT FROM ANYONE THAT YOU HAVE NOT APPROVED TO LIVE IN THAT HOME</strong>.  If you accept rent before you qualify them then you may have established them as a tenant.  Simply tell them that you cannot accept the rent until they fill out an application and are accepted by the landlord.   <strong>DO NOT HAVE ANYONE SIGN A RENTAL AGREEMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE RUN CREDIT, RENTAL AND CRIMINAL CHECKS ON THEM AND THEY HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED</strong>.  If any of the reports come back unfavorable there is nothing you can do about it because you have established them as a tenant by signing the agreement/lease.</p><h2>Acceptance Briefing</h2><p>Once you have determined that an individual is qualified to live in the community and all the proper documentation has been explained and signed, you should consider a meeting with the new resident.  Use the Park Rules &amp; Regulations as a briefing tool.  The conversation should not be a ""laying down of the law"", but rather an open discussion of what is expected of both the new resident and community management.  New residents may not know their responsibilities (despite signing numerous documents outlining their rights/responsibilities), thus it is your responsibility to clarify and remind them of their responsibilities.  Be sure your new resident understands such things as:</p><ol><li>Rent is due on the first of each month:<ol><li>If rent is paid after the 5th day, the residents will be faced with a late fee.</li><li>If not paid by the 8th day, the resident will receive a 72-hour notice.</li><li>Residents must give 30 days written notice to vacate space or they intend to sell their manufactured home.</li></ol></li><li>Help your new resident be a good neighbor.  Be sure that he/she is informed about:<ol><li>Quiet hours</li><li>Pet Control</li><li>Laundry room/Recreation room hours</li><li>Swimming pool hours</li><li>Review Rules and Regulation and remind the new resident that they are strictly enforced.</li></ol></li></ol><h2>Statement of Policy – Complying with the Truth in Renting Act</h2><p>As of July 1, 1992, all manufactured home communities renting space for manufactured dwellings have been required to provide prospective and existing tenants with a Statement of Policy.  The applicants must receive their Statement of Policy before signing the rental agreement.  Existing tenants who have not previously received a copy of the Statement of Policy and are on month-to-month rental agreements must receive their copy at the time the next 90-day rent increases notice is issued (ORS 90.510(3)(b). All other existing tenants shall receive a copy of the statement of policy upon expiration of their current rental agreement and before signing a new agreement.</p><p>While a Statement of Policy is not technically a contract, it is an important document.  A tenant or rental applicant who makes their decisions or changes their position in reliance upon the policies set forth in the statement may be entitled to hold the landlord to those written policies.  As proof of delivery of the Statement of Policy to tenants or applicants, it is advised to get a signed receipt.</p><p>A landlord who intentionally and deliberately fails to provide a Statement of Policy as required by ORS 90.510, or delivers a legally defective one, may be subject to a lawsuit.</p><p>The Statement of Policy is required to include the following information in summary form:</p><ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;""><li>The location and approximate size of the space to be rented.</li><li>The federal fair housing age classification and present zoning that affect the use of the rented space.</li><li>The facility policy regarding rent adjustment and a rent history for the space to be rented.  The rent history must, at a minimum, show the rent amounts on January 1 of each of the five preceding calendar years or during the length of the landlord's ownership, leasing or subleasing of the facility, whichever period is shorter.</li><li>All personal property, services and facilities to be provided by the landlord.</li><li>All installation charges imposed by the landlord and installation fees imposed by government agencies.</li><li>The facility policy regarding rental agreement termination including but not limited to closure of the facility.</li><li>The facility policy regarding facility sale.</li><li>The facility policy regarding informal dispute resolution.</li><li>Utilities and services available, the person furnishing them and the person responsible for payment.</li><li>If a tenants' association exists for the facility, a one-page summary about the tenants' association that shall be provided to the landlord by the tenants' association and shall be attached to the statement of policy.</li><li>Any facility policy regarding the removal of a manufactured dwelling, including a statement that removal may impact the market value of a dwelling.</li></ol><h2>Tenant Files</h2><p>Before any tenant moves into your community the tenant's file should contain the following information:</p><ol><li>Completed Application</li><li>Signed Rental Agreement.

"44","44","1","Overview of Rental Application Procedures","<p>As a community manager, you will normally be charged with accepting or rejecting prospective residents.  This is one of the most important functions that you will perform as a manager of a manufactured home community.  <em>Done properly and effectively, the rental application and screening process will minimize potential problems in landlord – resident relations.  If the process is done incorrectly the seeds of future problems will be sown.</em> Every prospective resident should be given sufficient information to make an informed decision about living in a manufactured home community.</p><p>When an individual stops by the manufactured home community office inquiring on the possibility of becoming a resident, <strong>always</strong> give them an application packet.  <em>Anyone who is interested in applying should be given the application packet – <strong>inconsistency</strong> in giving out application packets could lead to cause of action by the resident selling the home in the community or a fair housing violation.</em></p><p>The application packet is your opportunity to sell the prospective resident on your community.  Include in the application packet an application and ""Minimum Criteria Standards"", optional information may include what homes are available in the community, a community newsletter, information on the history of the community, the advantages of living in a manufactured home community etc.  You may also want to include at this time a copy of the rental/lease agreement, rules and regulations, rent history, and statement of policy.  Remember, you want to sell the prospective resident on your community, but you also want them to make a well informed decision.</p><p>Providing a prospective resident's with extensive information regarding your manufactured home community allows the applicant to evaluate for themselves if they qualify.   Including what your expectations are in order to qualify and expectations and requirements to maintain residency in the community allows the prospective resident to self qualify.</p><h2>Rental Application Process</h2><p>The overall rental application process should include:</p><ol><li>Review application to make sure it has been completely filled out.</li><li>Check to make sure that the applicant has included social security number, driver license information etc.</li><li>Provide the applicant with a copy of the Statement of Policy (keep a signed copy or receipt for your file), the rent history of the space, Rental Agreement/Lease, Park Rules &amp; Regulations, RV Storage Agreement and Pet Agreement (if applicable), and a Flood Plain Notice.

"45","45","1","Screening Criteria – Essential to the Application Process","<p>Your ""Screening Criteria"" is another important document that should be provided to an interested applicant.  This is the document that will determine where you draw the line between acceptance and denial.  Your ""Screening Criteria"" is a written statement of the factors the landlord considers in deciding whether to accept of reject an applicant and any qualification required for acceptance.  What can you have on that list?  That is up to you.  Here is a brief list to get you started: unsatisfactory rental references, the absence of any prior tenant history or credit history, unsatisfactory character references, criminal history, bankruptcy filed in the past two years, payment of rent problems, no social security number, and inaccurate information on the application, insufficient debt to income ratio.  All of these are reasons for denial – it is up to you establish them as a basis for acceptance into you community.  For example – maybe you accept applicants with felony conviction that are 20 years or older – it is up to you to include that on your screening criteria.</p><p>Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations – write a ""screening criteria"" and apply it uniformly.  Used properly and consistently it can be a tool that keeps you above any suspicion of discrimination.  The one limit on your screening criteria is that you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or sources of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone – even if they are in a protected class – if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria that you establish in your screening criteria.  Often potential applicants will ""self screen"" themselves by reading your ""screening criteria"" and realizing that they do not qualify, thus saving you and the potential applicant time and energy.</p><p>Screening/Admission Criteria: All applicants should be presented with a full explanation of the established basis for acceptance or rejection. This should be a written statement of any factors a landlord considers in deciding whether to accept or reject an applicant and any qualifications required for acceptance.

You will be in the awkward position of having to explain why you made the exception to one applicant and not to another applicant.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.

However, you can deny tenancy to anyone – even if they are in a protected class – if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria.</strong></p><p>For example: If someone applies for a space in your park and reveals that they are Catholic and have a bad credit record you cannot deny tenancy based on the fact that the individual is Catholic.  However, you may deny the tenancy based on the fact that the prospective tenant has bad credit so long as the minimum screening criteria have been consistently applied.</p><p>Tell the applicant that you require a certain amount of time to screen the completed application, but that they will be notified within seven days, in accordance with Oregon law.

"48","48","1","The Tenant Application and Screening Process by Phil Querin","<p><strong>(Reprinted from MHCO ""Community Update"" Spring 2010)</strong></p><p><strong>Generally</strong> The tenant application process is one of the least understood by landlords and managers.  This lack of familiarity can result in significant liability to park owners.  The purpose of this article is to set forth the applicable laws governing the process, and discuss some tips and traps that may be useful when certain issues and problems arise.</p><h2><strong>Screening Criteria</strong></h2><p>The manufactured housing section of Oregon's landlord-tenant law provides that ""Any conditions the landlord applies in approving a purchaser...as a tenant in the event the tenant elects to sell the home"" should be disclosed in the rental or lease agreement.""[1] Although those conditions must be in conformance with state and federal laws, there are no limitations or restrictions as to what may be placed in the rental or lease agreement.</p><p>MHCO's rental and lease agreement forms[2] contain a number of criteria that landlords may impose, such as:  (a) prior rental references; (b) unsatisfactory credit history or no credit history; (c) character references; (d) criminal history; (e) insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly space rent and other expense obligations imposed by the rental or lease agreement; (f) the presence, number and size of pets; (g) age verification criteria if the park is a 55+ facility; (h) evidence of falsified or misleading material information; (i) refusal to sign a written lease or rental agreement; (j) additional occupants; and (k) adverse public record information.</p><p>Although there may be other criteria that landlords may wish to use when deciding whether to accept an applicant as a tenant, the above list is very comprehensive, and should be sufficient in imposing adequate guidelines when a tenant wishes to sell their home on site.  MHCO additionally has an application form which solicits this and other information from prospective tenants.</p><p>Landlords and managers should become familiar with the criteria imposed in their rental agreements and rental application forms.  Additionally, they should not rely upon the application information submitted to them without a thorough background check that provides the necessary verification.  Although Oregon law imposes a 7-day period within which landlords have to respond to a submitted application, it does not prohibit landlords from imposing a longer period so long as the applicant agrees.  Additionally, Oregon law expressly states that the 7-day period does not commence if the application is incomplete or inaccurate.  Accordingly, landlords and managers would be wise to immediately return any submitted application if it is incomplete – and upon discovering that the prospective tenant/purchaser provided inaccurate information, the application should also be returned.  Accepting an incomplete application or continuing with the process after discovering that the applicant has provided bad information can result in an argument by the existing tenant or the new applicant that the landlord is intentionally delaying the process.</p><p>It is also important to note that Oregon law permits the ""...landlord and the prospective purchaser (to) agree to a longer time period for the landlord to evaluate the prospective purchaser's application or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord's screening or admission criteria.""  Thus, as noted on the MHCO Application form, there is a place for the landlord to insert a period longer than the statutory seven day period.  If the landlord suspects any delay, either on the applicant's part or his own part, a longer period should be inserted.  If the applicant rejects this extension, then the landlord can decide whether he wants to proceed to process the application at all.</p><p>Note: If a tenant has not previously given the landlord the 10 days' advance notice of intent to sell as required in ORS 90.680(4) (a), the landlord's seven day response time is extended to 10 days.  But remember, in no instances does the landlord have to receipt and process an inaccurate or incomplete application.  It is better not to accept a defective application – or return it immediately upon finding that it is inaccurate or incomplete, than continuing to process it.</p><p>If a landlord requires a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser the application the landlord shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale. It is important to remember that the terms of these park document given to the prospective tenant need not be the same as those in the existing (i.e. selling) tenant's documents.[3]</p><h2>Park Documents</h2><p>Landlords and managers should always remember that when they change one of the park documents, they may have to change others. This is because of two risks: (a) The failure to incorporate a change in the lease, say, into the Statement of Policy, and (b) An inconsistency between one or more of the park documents, such as the rental agreement and the rules.  Rules can generally be changed in the middle of a tenancy, but rental agreements cannot.  So landlords should remember to make sure their documents are all internally consistent.</p><h2>Fair Housing Laws</h2><p>The state and federal fair housing laws are essentially – but not completely – the same.  Landlords and managers should familiarize themselves with any special ordinances found in their city or county laws.  However, Oregon law prohibits any form of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing when directed at the following protected classes: ""...race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status or source of income.""[4]  The easiest, best, and safest way to deal with the risk of a discrimination claim is to make all screening criteria facially neutral.  Do not have rules which – even unintentionally - could have a negative impact on a member of a protected class.</p><p>In Oregon, most claims of discrimination relate to familial status.  Examples range from managers encouraging families to purchase and reside in one particular area of the community (where there are more children), to making off-hand comments to applicants (e.g. ""there would be very few children for your kids to play with here"") that may be construed as indicating a desire not to rent to people with children.  For this reason, landlords and managers should strive to apply their screening criteria neutrally regardless of the applicant's membership in a protected class.</p><p>Additionally, caution should be exercised in answering questions over the phone, since federal and state ""testers"" have been known to test parks by making multiple phone calls asking various loaded questions, such as ""Is this a good place to raise my children?""  If the community is a family park, the best response to open-ended telephone inquiries is to tell the caller that it is a family park, open to all, and that they are welcome to come in and pick up an application for processing.</p><p>One of the biggest areas of concern for landlords and managers today involve issues of immigration status.  At the risk of minimizing the problem, there is one basic rule that landlords and managers should always remember when screening applicants.  While it is not a ""silver bullet,"" it should help avoid the vast majority of issues regarding immigration status.  Never treat any single applicant differently from another.  This means that landlords should not automatically ""suspect"" that certain persons are illegally in this country and then impose more rigorous screening criteria on them alone.  It is best not to ask about immigration status.[5]  If the applicant passes the same screening criteria imposed upon others, and all of the information in their application checks out, you should accept the current applicant, regardless of whether you have suspicions about their immigration status. One of the frequently asked questions is whether a landlord may insist that applicants provide their social security number.  While this is not automatically illegal, it can be when applied to some applicants and not others.  Consistency is the name of the game.  Do not request verification in some cases and not others.  Do not accept some tenants who fail to provide the number, but accept others (who are not obviously immigrants) without also providing such proof.</p><p>Another area of concern is occupancy limits or extra occupancy charges.[6]  This is somewhat of a grey area because Oregon law currently permits a two person per bedroom rule – assuming that it is expressly listed as part of the park's screening criteria and uniformly applied.  However, the problem is that federal law contains no specific occupancy limits.  This means that, in theory, one could be in compliance with state law, while violating federal law.  For example, if a family consisted of two adults and three children who owned a 2-bedroom home, a ""2-persons per bedroom"" requirement would mean that they could not move into the park.  But if the third child was an infant who slept in the parents' room, one may ask whether this standard is reasonable, even though it complies with Oregon law.  At the risk of violating federal law, which imposes no such occupancy limits, the better approach might be to avoid the ""slippery slope"" problem entirely, by not creating occupancy limits.[7]</p><p>Perhaps the most difficult of screening criteria issues is in the area of assistance animals.  Since handicap is a protected class, this means that if one could establish a legitimate need for an assistance animal they could not be prevented from having one – even though the park might have a one-pet policy and this might be their second pet.  This could be so even though the animal was not trained or certified in providing assistance.  MHCO has Form 15 that may be given to tenants applying for a ""reasonable accommodation"" which is the technical term used when an allegedly handicapped person requests relief from strict application of a rule that interferes with their handicapped. [8] As most landlords and managers know, the handicap protections can be severely stretched.  There are many reasons for this, including, among other things, the handicap may be allegedly psychological, and the tenant has nothing more than a note from a doctor – not a treating psychologist or psychiatrist.</p><p>The other difficult issue is that assistant animals are not technically ""pets"" and therefore are not subject to the requirement that the Pet Agreement be completed.  Ultimately it comes down to a rule of reason and proof.  Does it appear that the person requesting the accommodation is legitimately handicapped? Do they have a known history of the handicap – that is, has it ever come up before?  Does it appear that the claim of a handicap is new, and possibly raised as a pretext, say to circumvent a one-pet policy?</p><p>Ultimately, the issue comes down to public safety in the community.  For example, if the tenant wanted to have a pit bull (in violation of a dangerous breed prohibition) or a bull-mastiff (in violation of a size restriction), the landlord should ask which battle he or she wants to fight?  If the tenant isn't credible, has a history of skirting the rules on this or other issues, it might make sense to refuse and let them take the next step.  If they bring the animal into the park in light of the denial, you will have a choice; either do nothing or send out a notice of violation which would require removal of the animal.  The risk in allowing dangerous or oversized breed into the park is that it may harm someone, and then the landlord will have to defend a lawsuit for failing to enforce their own rules.  Additionally, in consenting, the precedent has been set, now permitting such animals based upon a tenant's assertion the need it for assistance.  Remember, ""reasonable accommodations"" need only be ""reasonable.""  Dogs with vicious propensities or who pose danger to children because of their size, are not the only type of assistance animals available.</p><p>Marijuana cards raise the same issue, although perhaps even worse, since the cards seem to be freely given to almost anyone.  In some cases, however, this too can be dealt with on another level. If the persons with medical marijuana cards have an inordinate amount of traffic at their home throughout the day and night, perhaps the issue is one for the police, since it is still illegal to sell or distribute marijuana, medical or otherwise.  If they are dealing in the illegal drug, careful (documented) scrutiny of these comings and goings might prove useful.</p><h2>Miscellaneous Screening and Application Issues</h2><p>Occasionally, tenants apply for occupancy even though they cannot afford to purchase the home on their own, and perhaps would not qualify under the financial criteria imposed for acceptance into the park.  However, they may have a parent or other person willing to assist in the purchase and willing to guarantee the applicant's performance.  There is nothing wrong with this approach, assuming that the guarantor passes all of the financial criteria the park would impose.  First, remember that the guarantor will not be living in the home – they may have their own housing requirements that impose financial limitations on them.  If the tenant defaults, can the guarantor actually afford to pay the space rent?  Under such cases, the financial criteria applied to co-signers should be more rigorous than those imposed on tenant applicants.  Secondly, landlords should be sure to have their attorney draft a solid guarantee agreement that gives them the right to seek payment against the guarantor without having to first evict the tenant.  Third, before accepting a co-signer, a landlord should ask whether they have a sufficiently significant relationship with the applicant such that they will actually be willing to subsidize the space rent if it is not paid.</p><p>A fundamental problem in the tenant screening process is the denial process.  Landlords must be prompt in informing applicants if their application is denied.  Obviously, a denial can provoke an angry response.  Landlords need to be proactive.  MHCO has two forms to address the issue, so that the landlord or manager does not have to engage in any more explanation than that provided in the form.  MHCO Form 10, identifies the source of the material or information resulting in the turn down.  That is all the landlord is required to do, unless it comes from a credit reporting agency. In that case, MHCO's Form 10A should be given so that applicant has the ability to know which credit company was involved and track down the source of the information.</p><p>It is due to financial issues that many applicants get turned down.  Especially today. For that reason, MHCO has developed the ""Straight Talk"" form, describing manufactured home living and affordability issues.  It should be used in all cases, if possible.</p><p>Although we discussed the Statement of Policy (""SOP"") above, there are two additional points to be made: (a) Always be sure to obtain a receipt (MHCO Form 7C), since it is proof positive that the resident received the SOP and the Rules and Rental or Lease Agreement.  Without the receipt, the tenant can deny receiving it, and the burden of proof to establish delivery is on the landlord.  This can be a difficult task unless witnesses were present who can verify delivery.  (b) The second item to note is use of the Rent History attachment to the SOP a copy of the Rent History (Form 7A).  This permits the tenant to see the monthly base rent for each of the five years preceding the current year of tenancy.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important (and newest) forms if not used, is the Flood Plain Notice (MHCO Form 6).  It notifies those residents whose homes are located in all or part of a 100-year floodplain.  This means that landlords and/or their managers, should look at a current FEMA map to determine whether all or a portion of their park is located inside such a plain.  If so, those residents whose spaces are in the floodplain should be notified.  While technically, being located in a 100-year floodplain means that flood water levels are statistically expected to flood onto the plain once every 100 years, most people realize that over the course of 100 years, there could be three or more such floods or none at all.  The MHCO form, in compliance with Oregon statute, suggests to those receiving the notice that they consider obtaining flood insurance.  The good news is that once having given this notice, a landlord is not liable for any uninsured water loss suffered by the resident due to a flood; the bad news is that failing to give the notice can subject the landlord to the lesser of two months' rent or the resident's actual damages, whichever is less.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Landlords would have fewer tenant problems if they took more time during the screening process. This means resisting the temptation to fill a space quicker than the approval process actually takes.  Unfortunately, the desire to have the rental flow commence quickly sometimes results in the process becoming rushed.  And landlords and managers should never allow the applicant to rush them.  Nor should they ever permit an applicant to move into a home before the process has been completed and a new rental agreement signed.  Lastly, fairness and uniformity in screening will help to avoid the ever-present liability that can occur under the federal and state Fair Housing laws.</p><p>©Copyright 2010 by Phillip C. Querin.

This creates the appearance that questions regarding immigration status are reserved for Latinos or those from other Central American countries.  National origin is a constitutionally protected class.  As a result, this type of selective screening creates (in legal terms) a ""disparate impact"" on folks from Mexico and Central America, and can therefore be found to be a violation of the Fair Housing laws.</p><p>[6] Occupancy limits are sometimes used as ""tools"" by landlords to impose restrictions on persons with larger families, and therefore poses a potential violation of the familial status protected status.

"52","52","1","Overview of Rental Agreement","<p>The renting of spaces by manufactured homes in a manufactured home community is governed by the Oregon Residential Landlord and Tenant Act in Chapter 90 of the Oregon Revised Statutes.  The Act requires that a written rental Agreement, Statement of Policy and Rules and Regulations be provided to each tenant renting a space in a manufactured housing community.  This agreement, which includes or incorporates the community rules and regulations, becomes the contract that governs the relationship between the landlord and the tenant.  Much of what you may or may not be able to do in your community will be addressed in the rental agreement.</p><p>Although many residents in your community may have rental agreements that are 5 or 10 years old, residents moving in to your community must be given a current rental agreement that conforms with the most recent amendments of Residential Landlord and Tenant Act and Federal Fair Housing Act.  MHCO form '5A', ""Manufactured Dwelling Space Rental Agreement/Dispute Resolution Addendum"" (for month to month tenancies) and MHCO form '5B', ""Manufactured Dwelling Space Lease Agreement/Dispute Resolution Addendum"" are available through MHCO or you may have a rental agreement drafted by your attorney.</p><p>The Oregon Legislature occasionally adopts revisions to the Landlord and Tenant Act. Landlords and managers should make sure that they are utilizing the most current Rental Agreement.  Rental Agreements generally may not be changed after execution, with the exception of mutual agreement of the parties; rent increases; and statutory changes (requirements of revised laws will apply even though not stated in the pre-existing agreement).  ORS 90.510(4).</p><p>The MHCO Rental Agreement is designed to meet the current requirements of Oregon State Law.  The Rental Agreement, which is intended for use in all classifications of parks, can be changed or altered to suit individual situations.  In either event, you should consult with your attorney in order to insure that the agreement you choose meets all the legal requirements.  It is important to remember that the tenant cannot be required to waive any rights that are granted to the tenant/resident by Oregon State Law.</p><p>The Rental Agreement should be completed and signed by both the landlord and the tenant/resident <strong>PRIOR</strong> to the home being moved into the community or <strong>PRIOR</strong> to the tenant/resident occupying a home already sited in the community.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>","<p>The renting of spaces by manufactured homes in a manufactured home community is governed by the Oregon Residential Landlord and Tenant Act in Chapter 90 of the Oregon Revised Statutes.

(Note: The 10 days will run parallel with the 7 day application process – i.e. if the resident notifies the landlord of intent to sell the home and does not give the 10 day notice, then the application process time to approve or reject will take 10 days rather than 7 days.)</li><li>The existing resident must advise the prospective purchaser that they have to fill out an application with the landlord and be approved.</li><li>Do not move anyone into the manufactured home that has not been approved through the tenant screening and approval process.</li></ol><p>If you are aware of a sale and do not have the purchaser fill out an application, or fail to advise the seller and prospective purchaser in writing that the application has been rejected within 7 days after they fill out the application, then the purchaser can move into the mobile home under the same condition of the rental agreement of the seller.  Basically, they assume the existing rental agreement you have with the seller of the manufactured home.</p><p>If a prospective tenant refuses to provide you with the necessary information for you to qualify them, then it is an automatic denial of the applicant.</p><p>It is important that an application is filled out and you check out the person carefully.  You should check them out the same as you do any prospective resident.  You do not have to approve the person just because they are buying an existing home in the park.  If they have a bad credit or rental history, they can be refused as a prospective tenant.  This does not necessarily kill the sale of the mobile home.  They can still purchase the home, they just cannot keep it in the park.  You need to provide a written rejection to both the seller and prospective purchaser within 7 days.  You need to advise them why they were not accepted.  If you denied them for credit reasons, give the applicant the name and phone number of the company who provided you with the report.  Advise the applicant that they can call them if they have any questions regarding the report.</p><p>It is important that you advise anyone that has a ""For Sale"" sign on their manufactured home that they do the three things listed at the beginning of this section.  Failure by the prospective resident to fill out an application or the landlord's failure to advise them that they do not qualify can be a very costly mistake in the event they move in and then you give them notice.  It makes for ill feelings for everyone involved.</p><p>If a resident sells their home and the new owner of the home has not filled out an application prior to moving into the home, you do not need to accept them as a resident.

Exemptions for specific industries have been granted as late as the first week of December 2010.  MHCO and MHI are conducting research on this topic and will be providing additional information as it becomes available.  The Federal Trade Commission  link is http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/redflagsrule/index.shtml   and contains a lot of information that should be of interest to community owners and manufactured home community retailers.  If you are subject to the new rule there is a template developed by the FTC for businesses at low risk for identity theft at this site.  While we are still looking into this and monitoring developments in the Congress, it is likely that if a community owner is not billing for utilities, is not providing loans for residents purchasing homes, and is not acting as a retailer selling homes, they are not probably covered by the Red Flags Rule.</p><h2>The ""Red Flags"" Rule: What You Need to Know</h2><p>As of June 1, 2010 the Federal Trade Commission has begun enforcement of the 'Red Flags' rule which mandates creditors and financial institutions to implement identity theft prevention programs. It's important to spend some time discussing the rule, including what it is and what it means for you</p><h2>The ""Red Flags"" Rule—In Plain English</h2><p>The full title is this: ""Identity Theft Red Flags and Address Discrepancies under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003"" (FACT). It amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  The rule was written specifically for companies making loans, such as banks and commercial lending institutions, but a portion of it extends to rental property owners and managers since both rely on consumer reports (e.g. credit) that (1) ask for sensitive information, such as social security numbers, and (2) could turn up address discrepancies. The philosophy behind this rule is simple: sensitive information must be kept secure to prevent identity theft, and a discrepancy in address could indicate fraud.</p><p>The rule requires that ""reasonable"" policies be in place to prevent identity theft and to verify a person's identity when an address discrepancy is reported. In the case of address discrepancy, if the property manager can't work out the discrepancy, the rule says he/she is not to rent to this individual.</p><h2>What the Red Flags Rule Means for Rental Owners &amp; Property Managers</h2><p>While the rule has caused some confusion, compliance is straightforward. More than likely, you're probably already in compliance since the only thing that rental owners or property managers have to show is that they have a ""reasonable"" process in place for preventing identity theft and for checking IDs, verifying IDs, and following up/asking about any discrepancies.</p><p>For example, how do you destroy electronic and paper records that contain sensitive information? Or how about this: if someone gives one address on his or her rental application, but the license lists another address, what's your policy for handling this situation? As long as you have reasonable policies in place, you're in compliance.</p><h2>Do I need to create a special report if I suspect fraud?</h2><p>The other commonly asked question about the Red Flags rule (beyond ""how do I comply"") is this: do we need to report suspected fraud? The answer—for better or worse—is no. If you believe someone is trying to perpetrate a fraud, there's no requirement beyond not renting to this individual.</p><h2>Still Unsure About the Red Flags Rule? Contact Your Screening Partner</h2><p>Laws, rules, and amendments result in legitimate questions and concerns, so we understand people's trepidation regarding the Red Flags rule. While it's true that you're likely already in compliance, it can't hurt to contact your screening partner and ask to review with them your policies and systems.</p><p>For full details, visit the FTC website at <a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/redflagsrule"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ftc.gov/redflagsrule</a></p><p>The information in this article should not be construed as legal advice.

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">MHCO Defeated:<br></span></strong></p>

<p><strong>HB 2885</strong> - This bill originally applied to all &nbsp;residential properties that had Department of Education employees who where evicted - required landlord to inventory their belongs and return appropriate property to the Department of Education. &nbsp;This bill has been amended to exclude residential property.</p>
<p><strong>HB 3073</strong> - This bill expanded upon HB 2383 from 2009 that established a 14 day right of first refusal. &nbsp;This bill was designed to increase the 14 days to an undetermined amount. &nbsp;I will have more about this issue in a subsequent update on the landlord tenant coalition bill. &nbsp;Representative Nathanson was hoping to increase the 14 days to a higher number.</p>
<p><strong>HB 3183</strong> - This bill lift the ban on local governments from passing rent control ordinances. &nbsp;It will still have a hearing later this session, but since it the public hearing did not occur before today the bill cannot move forward to a work session. &nbsp;It can only have a hearing - nothing more. &nbsp;That being said, please do not be complacent when a hearing is scheduled - we need as many people to show up to oppose this bill as possible. &nbsp;We will be dealing with this issue for the next session or two - we need to be vigilant.</p>

"275","275","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Reasonable Accommodation and Caregivers","Question:  A resident wants her son to be her caregiver but lives in a 55 & Older community.  The community’s minimum second person age is 45, and the son is 38.  Can the landlord ask the resident to complete a ""Reasonable Accommodation Form""?  Does the son have to fill out a resident application?  


Answer:  The answer would be the same regardless of whether it is a family park or a 55+ park. This is an issue of making a “reasonable accommodation” under the federal fair housing act.  Handicapped persons are members of a protected class.  Is the resident “handicapped”?  With the various infirmities that can come with older age, there is a likelihood that the resident could qualify as a member of that class.  If so, then the landlord should give the tenant a MHCO Request for Reasonable Accommodation form.  If everything checks out, granting a “reasonable accommodation” to the community’s minimum age requirement for a second person in a senior park from 45 to 38 is probably not unreasonable.  It will not cost the landlord anything.  It will not set a “precedent” since federal law requires such concessions for handicapped.  All in all, it is a fairly easy solution.  

Note that I am not commenting on the validity of the request itself. This accommodation is not costly or risky, so the analysis is fairly simple.  The harder cases are where the resident wants to bring in a pit bull or other breed with a dangerous reputation; as an “assistance animal,” or the assistance provider, while a relative, has a recent criminal record for violence.  If these cases, the landlord has to evaluate the legitimacy of the request, the need to accommodate a “pit bull” or ex-con, versus some other alternative, and the likelihood the resident will contest an outright denial.

In this case, I have no problem with having the son fill out an informational form containing contact information, background information and a criminal check.  However, since he is not applying for residency, his financial qualifications are irrelevant, since he is there to lend assistance, not pay rent.

"316","316","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Abandoned Home with Lots of Deferred Taxes","Question:     We are currently dealing with an abandoned home where the tenant has passed away and he was in a ""Senior Tax Deferral"" program through the Oregon Dept. of Revenue (“DOR”). According to our county tax collector the deceased tenant’s account is current, since the DOR has paid them ever since the tenant entered the program in 1999.  A title search on the home has the DOR listed as a lien holder.  

My question is if and when the abandoned property is sold at a private auction and we (the Landlord) win with the highest sealed bid, are we liable for the taxes in the program?  Are they considered already paid? Is the DOR simply a lien holder or are they considered a tax collector?  Side note: According to the tax collector, this home is valued at approximately $20,000.
 
Answer:   The Department of Revenue (“DOR”) is treated like any other lienholder.  It is critical that before the 45-day letter is sent, the park check with the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services (“DCBS”) to determine if there are any lienholders on title.  We understand that DOR is now showing up on the DCBS records.  Remember, if they show up on the record and you fail to give them notice, they could come back against the park for failing to notify them. 

If they show up on the DCBS records, they should be copied on the 45-day letter, and given all of the same rights as other lienholders, e.g. entering into a one year storage agreement, paying the storage fees, selling the home, etc.  Currently, it is our understanding the DOR does not sign and returned storage agreements.  

If there is a purchase money lien on the property, it will be superior to the DOR and then it [the DOR] will only get payment if there is any equity from the sale.  Since the property is worth more than $8,000, if there is no sale, it would go to auction.  [Caveat: Even if the DOR doesn’t respond to the 45-day letter, they still must be notified of the upcoming auction, per the statute.  Again, there could be liability to the DOR if they have a valid lien, got the 45-day letter, but weren’t informed of the date and time of the auction.] 

As a lienholder, the DOR is behind the park, in terms of payment of cost, and then the county tax collector [which presumably is current – thanks to the DOR].  Next, as a lienholder, the DOR would receive some payment.  If there are any further proceeds, they would go to the tenant, and if the tenant cannot be located, then to the county fund.  

If the landlord follows these procedures, there is no remaining liability to the DOR for and of the taxes paid under the program.

I believe there is a web page where you can look up service members, but in this case we don’t have a social security number on the resident, so we couldn’t look him up anyway.</p> <p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: I've never heard of a judge denying a declaration because a landlord hadn't run the tenant's information through Act’s website.&nbsp; In order to do the search, you need the tenant's first and last name and SSN. &nbsp;You can also put in their birth date, but I think the SSN gets the best results. The Act’s database cannot complete the search if you don't have a SSN or birth date. I'm surprised that the judge didn't set over the hearing and simply direct the you to the website.&nbsp; Perhaps you could have determined the answer if you had entered the birth date – assuming you had it.&nbsp; I suspect the judge was new to the job.</p> <p>Here's the link to their site: https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/scra/scraHome.do</p> <p>When we don't have a SSN or birth date, we put a statement in the declaration similar to the one you used.&nbsp; Basically, all you should need to do is show that you have conducted a reasonable investigation based upon the information you have, and that you have been unable to determine through the website or other evidence, that the person is protected by the Act.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here's an example that we've used at Multnomah County Circuit Court:</p> <p><em>Due to lack of information, the Department of Defense’s SCRA military records website could not confirm whether or not defendants, John and Mary Doe, are currently on active duty.

"311","311","3","Phil Querin Q&A Resident Over Pays Rent - How to Account for Late Fees","Question. We had a situation come up recently that we would like your opinion on.  With this particular lease, rent is due on the 1st and a late fee is assessed if not received by midnight of the 5th.  We send 72-hour notices on the 8th of the month at the earliest.  

In this situation, a tenant has purposely over-paid rent on a number of payments in order to build up a credit balance with us.  He has accrued several late fees that have been assessed due to late payments after the 5th of the month - but before a 72 hour notice is ever sent.  We recently deducted the accrued late fees from the credit balance he had built up.  Because there was still a credit balance showing on his account after deducting the late fees, we did not send him any further notices about the late fees being assessed or deducted.  He is now claiming that it was illegal to deduct the late fees from the credit balance without our sending him a notice or invoice.  Your thoughts?

Answer.  It is unclear if there ever was an actual agreement between landlord and tenant that the overpayments were to be applied toward late fees.  For purposes of this question, I will assume there was an understanding of sorts [what tenant intentionally overpays, without a reason?], but presumably not in writing; hence, this dispute.

The lack of any written agreement invites an argument as to how the credits were to be applied.  There is an argument this was “prepaid rent” under ORS 90.100(33) (Definitions). Prepaid rent is a payment for rent not yet due.  Prepaid rent is treated much like a security deposit, and must be accounted for at the end of the tenancy.  See, ORS 90.300 (Security Deposits; Prepaid Rent).  Rent [prepaid or otherwise] cannot be applied to such things as fees or deposits.   See, ORS 100(35) (Definitions).

In this situation, without a written agreement specifically defining what the prepayments were, and how they were to be applied, I would say the tenant may have an argument that without his consent, the money could not be applied to anything except a rent that is already due.  In other words, you may not apply the monies to non-rent charges.

The landlord-tenant statutes don’t specifically address this type of situation, so it’s a toss-up whether the practice was legal or illegal.  [I assume that your rental agreement specifies whether late fees must be assessed in writing. Typically, no writing is required – the fees just become due within a certain period of time.]  In any event, I don’t think this is arrangement is a good practice without having it in writing.   In the future, if both landlord and tenant want to continue the practice, it should be in writing and specifically address: (a) What the payments are; (b) When, how and under what circumstances they may be applied; (c) Whether any prior notice and/or written accounting is necessary; and (d) Whether interest will accrue to the tenant for the monies held by the landlord before they are applied.

Answer: Oregon landlord tenant law allows service of notices three ways: first class mail, personal delivery and “nail and mail.”  ORS 90.155.
 
We always advise our clients to deliver notices by first class mail.  Not certified, not UPS, not FedEx, but good old fashioned first class mail with a stamp. They still make those. You can always get a certificate of mailing showing that you sent the notice on the day you say you did.
 
First class mail is not always an option; therefore, you can serve personally. When we say “personal delivery” it does not mean taping the notice to the door, or placing it under a windshield wiper (I’ve seen both cases), it means physically handing it to the person you are trying to give the notice to. Make a note of the time you sent it and if you can, bring a witness.

"277","277","3","Phil Querin Q&A  What Type of Fines May And May Not Be Levied By A MHC Landlord","Question: A landlord recently issued a fine to a resident for not cleaning up his yard.  The resident claimed that the landlord could not do this.  What does Oregon law say regarding the types of fines a landlord may and may not levy?

Answer: The answer is found in ORS 90.302 (Fees allowed for certain landlord expenses).  What follows is a brief summary:
(1)	A landlord may not charge a fee at the beginning of the tenancy for an anticipated expense (i.e. one that has not actually occurred).
(2)	A landlord may not require the payment of any fee except as provided in this statute.
(3)	The specific fee must be described in a written rental agreement.
(4)	The following list are the fees a landlord may charge:
a.	A late rent payment, pursuant to ORS 90.260.
b.	 A dishonored check, pursuant to ORS 30.701 (5). [Note that the amount of the fee may not exceed the amount described in ORS 30.701 (5) plus any amount that a bank has charged the landlord for processing the dishonored check.] 
c.	Removal or tampering with a properly functioning smoke alarm, smoke detector or carbon monoxide alarm, as provided in ORS 90.325 (2).
d.	 The violation of a written pet agreement or rule relating to pets in a facility, pursuant to ORS 90.530.
e.	The abandonment or relinquishment of a home during a fixed term tenancy without cause. [Note that the fee may not exceed one and one-half times the monthly rent. A landlord may not assess a fee under this section if the abandonment or relinquishment is pursuant to ORS 90.453 (2) (Termination of tenant who is victim of domestic violence), ORS 90.472 (Termination of tenant who is called to active state service) or ORS 90.475. (Termination of tenant sue to service with Armed Forces)]
f.	If the landlord assesses a fee under (e) above:
i.	The landlord may not recover unpaid rent for any period of the fixed term tenancy beyond the date that the landlord knew or reasonably should have known of the abandonment or relinquishment; 
ii.	The landlord may not recover damages related to the cost of renting the dwelling unit to a new tenant; and
iii.	ORS 90.410 (3) (Effect of tenant failure to give notice of absence) does not apply to the abandonment or relinquishment.
(5)	 Noncompliance with written rules or policies. [Note that the fee may not exceed $50.] 
(6)	A fee may be assessed under paragraph (5), above, only for the following types of noncompliance:
a.	The late payment of a utility or service charge that the tenant owes the landlord as described in ORS 90.315.
b.	Failure to clean up pet waste from the tenant’s space other than the home itself.
c.	Failure to clean up garbage, rubbish and other waste from the tenant’s space other than the home itself.
d.	Parking violations. 
e.	The improper use of vehicles within the premises.
(7)	 A landlord is not required to account to a tenant for, or return to, the tenant any fee. 
(8)	Except where the tenant abandons or relinquishes the space during a fixed term tenancy [see (4) e above], a landlord may not charge a tenant any form of liquidated damages, however designated. [Note: A liquidated damage is a pre-fixed amount that doesn’t necessarily relate directly to the actual amount of damages suffered by the landlord] 
(9)	Nonpayment of a fee is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent - but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause. 
(10)	The above laws regarding fines do not apply to:
a.	Attorney fees; 
b.	 Applicant screening charges; or
c.	 Charges for improvements or other actions that are requested by the tenant and are not required of the landlord by the rental agreement or by law.

"262","262","3","Phil Querin Q&A  When to Use 30 Day Notice of Eviction vs. 24 Hour Notice of Eviction","<p><strong>Question: </strong> We have a resident in the park who recently got into a verbal shouting match with another neighbor.  The resident was extremely intoxicated at the time and made threats and gestures that were very inappropriate and provocative.  There are some residents who want us to immediately issue a 24-hour notice.  However, until this incident, the resident has been a good tenant and never caused a problem.  How should we handle this?  This incident seems entirely out of character for this individual.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The statute governing the issuance of a 24-hour notice is ORS 90.396 [Acts or omissions justifying termination 24 hours after notice.]    Subsection (1)(f) states that a 24-hour notice may be appropriate in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>The tenant, someone in the tenant’s control or the tenant’s pet commits any act that is outrageous in the extreme, on the premises or in the immediate vicinity of the premises. For purposes of this paragraph, an act is outrageous in the extreme if the act is not described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection, but is similar in degree and is one that a reasonable person in that community would consider to be so offensive as to warrant termination of the tenancy within 24 hours, considering the seriousness of the act or the risk to others. An act that is outrageous in the extreme  is more extreme or serious than an act that warrants a 30-day termination under ORS 90.392. [Emphasis mine.]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in close cases, what is “outrageous” is frequently in the eyes of the beholder.  The question is was this truly an isolated incident for which you could give a 30-day notice that he could cure by simply not repeated within the following 30 days?  If he repeated it thereafter [i.e. within 6 months following the date of the 30-day notice] you could terminate with a 20-day, non-curable, notice.</p>
<p>In making a decision whether to do a 24-hour notice, which is non-curable, or a 30-day notice which is, you should consider the following factors:</p>
<p>1.   Has this ever occurred before?</p>
<p>2.   How long has the resident been in the park?</p>
<p>3.   Is there a reason to believe the conduct will be repeated?</p>
<p>4.   Does the resident have a drinking/emotional problem on a regular basis?</p>
<p>5.    Did the conduct pose any immediate threat to health or safety?</p>
<p>6.    Was actual violence involved?</p>
<p>If you genuinely believe that a 30-day notice would work, it will still provide you with the opportunity to issue a 20-day non-curable notice if he fell off the wagon again - either within the 30 days or within 180 days following the date of issuance of the 30 day notice.  Remember that the 24-hour notice is final, whereas the 30-day notice is not, because it can be “cured.”  This may be a case where you should issue the 30-day notice, and make it clear to him that the next time will be final.   In any event, the conduct should not be ignored – a notice should issue.</p>","<p><strong>Question: </strong> We have a resident in the park who recently got into a verbal shouting match with another neighbor.",,"1345070538","2"

Is  it  true  that  community  owners  with  existing  pools  will  now  have  to  buy  pool  lifts  or  construct accessible stairs into the pool?  If so, it will be a huge expense for many park owners.</p> <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The Americans with Disability Act, or “ADA” deals with  accommodations in two major  sectors,  public  (Title  II)  and  private  (Title  III).    The  public  sector  covers  state  and  local  governmental  facilities  and  the  private  sector  deals  with  private  entities  that  “own,  operate,  and  lease”  places  of  public  accommodation,  such  as  restaurants,  hotels,  theaters,  convention  centers,  retail  stores,  shopping  malls,  dry  cleaners,  laundromats,  pharmacies,  doctors'  offices,  hospitals,  museums,  libraries,  parks,  zoos,  amusement  parks,  private  schools,  day  care  centers,  health spa and bowling alleys.</p> <p>On  September  15,  2010,  the  United  States  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ),  who  enforces  the  ADA,  issued  revised  regulations  for  Titles  II  and  III.     Among  other  things,  the  new  regulations  include  new  accessibility  standards  for  swimming  pools.    Existing  swimming  pools  must  be  modified  to  comply  with  the 2010  guidelines  no  later  than March  12,  2012.   For  new construction,  the  2010  guidelines must be followed on a going forward basis.    Included  in  these  guidelines  are  swimming  pool  accessibility  requirements.  They  provide  that  any swimming pool with less than 300 linear feet of pool wall must provide one means of access  either  by  sloped  entry  or  by  the  installation  of  a  pool  lift.</p> <p>Any  pool  that  has  more  than  300  linear  feet  of  pool  wall  must  provide  two  means  of  access,  which  can  be  any  of  five  designated  means  of  access:    (1)  pool  lifts,  (2)  sloped  entries,  (3)  transfer  walls,  (4)  transfer  systems,  or  (5)  accessible pool stairs.    Having said this, it is clear that private manufactured housing communities are  neither public or  private  facilities that  offer  “public accommodations” under the  ADA  ‐  at least  insofar  as they do  not open their pool and recreational facilities to the general public.</p> <p>However, two words of warning:</p><ol> <li>While  the  ADA  does  not  strictly  cover  private  residential  facilities  such  as  apartments,  homes  and  manufactured  housing  communities,  if  a  park  resident  provides  child  day  care  services  open  to  the  public  in  his  or  her  private  residence,  those  portions  of  the  residence  used  for  that  purpose  are  subject  to  ADA’s  requirements.    So,  community  owners  and  managers  should  be  aware  if  any  of  their  residents  are  operating  such  services,  as  ADA  accessibility,  including  the  pool  area,  may  be  subject  to  ADA  requirements,  to  the  extent  that  the  resident  makes the park facilities available for use by the children.</li><li>The  Fair  Housing  Act,  which  is  administered  by  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (“HUD”),  prohibits  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  handicap.    To  that  extent,  landlords  arerequired  to  make  “reasonable  accommodations”  if  requested  by  their  handicapped  residents.   To  some extent, this could  apply  to  a pool or  other  recreational  facilities.   The  body of  law  as  to  what  constitutes  a  “reasonable  accommodation”  is  far  too  voluminous to  address here.    Suffice  it  to  say,  however,  that  a  landlord  is  not  required  to  make  such  an  accommodation  (e.g.  retrofitting  the  community’s  existing  swimming  pool)  if  the  cost  would  impose  an  undue  financial burden.</li> </ol> <p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS Q &amp; A SERVICE THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THIS SITE ARE PROVIDED AS A BENEFIT FOR OUR MEMBERS.

"98","98","1","MHCO Legislative Update - 5-25-2011 - MHCO Defeats Local Rent Control Legislation","The long awaited public hearing on HB 3183 - the bill to eliminate local preemption of rent control - was held yesterday morning. About 60-70  MHCO members showed up supporting community owners  - the residents had about 10 people and could only muster five people to testify publicly in favor to the legislation.   Six people testified on MHCO's behalf with several more waiting in the wings if needed.  There were enough community owners to require an overflow hearing room.  

Much of the resident testimony was directed at increasing taxes on their homes.  One Legislator suggested that the residents direct their complaints to the appropriate government taxing authorities and not community owners. Overall is was a good day for community owners - excellent testimony and information.   This was a good  opportunity to continue to educate Oregon Legislators.  MHCO's panel of six individuals representing a diverse section of the industry did an excellent job.

MHCO confirmed at the end of the day that this legislation is dead and will not move beyond the public hearing.  We all know these issues do not go away - look for this issue and may other rent control schemes to come up again in the future.  Until the next full legislative session - 2013 - this issue is done.

Thanks to those who testified on behalf of MHCO and those who were in attendance and where prepared to testify: Mike Wells, Gary Griglak, Richard Delaney, Kim Berry, Larry Engelgau, Dale Strom, Peter Schraner, Cory Poole, Robert Danielson and Troy Brost.

Deep appreciation to those took the time to attend the hearing - your presence was noted.

And a final note of thanks to all of you who sent e-mails.  Early yesterday morning I was talking to the chief of staff of one of the Legislators on  the committee and she commented that she was glad we finally reach the day of the rent control hearing - she was hoping it would be the end of all the rent control e-mails!  So thanks to all of you who made your presence known through e-mail.  Many thanks!

We are now in the final stretch of the 2011 Legislative Session.  We will keep you posted as we head into the final weeks.

Answer:  It’s easy to get confused. There is a lot to remember.  Generally all of the answers are contained in ORS 90.630 [Termination by landlord; causes; notice; cure; repeated nonpayment of rent].  Here is a short summary:

•	The landlord may terminate a rental agreement that is a month-to-month or fixed term tenancy in a manufactured housing community by giving not less than 30 days’ notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination if the tenant:
o	Violates a law or ordinance related to the tenant’s conduct as a tenant, including but not limited to a material noncompliance with ORS 90.740 [Tenant Obligations];
o	Violates a rule or rental agreement provision;
o	Is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587; or
o	Fails to pay a (i) a late charge pursuant to ORS 90.260; (ii) A fee pursuant to ORS 90.302; or (iii) a utility or service charge pursuant to ORS 90.534 or 90.536.
•	The tenant may avoid termination of the tenancy by correcting the violation within the 30-day period specified in notice of violation. However, if substantially the same act or omission recurs within six months after the date of the notice, the landlord may terminate the tenancy upon at least 20 days’ written notice specifying the violation and the date of termination of the tenancy.  In such cases, the tenant does not have a right to correct the violation – and the notice must so state. 
•	Oregon’s “three strikes” law only applies to cases in which the tenant is issued three 72-hour [or 144-hour] notices within a 12-month period.  [Caveat: All three notices must have been validly prepared and delivered or served. – PCQ] The “three strikes” law is found at ORS 90.630(8)-(10). As noted above, multiple violations of the same or similar rule within six months can result in the landlord’s issuance of a non-curable 20-day notice to the tenant.

They have asked that we sign a written contract which is recordable.&nbsp; The amount paid is confidential and that portion of the agreement may not be recorded.&nbsp; There are several provisions that cause us some concern, one of which is whether there might be some violation of the Oregon landlord-tenant law.&nbsp; What is your opinion?</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A</span></strong><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">nswer:</span></strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>Without actually seeing the contracts, I can only address what I know about such agreements in general.&nbsp; To that extent, this response must be considered general in nature, and not specific to any particular cable company or park.&nbsp; I do not practice any form of law that deals with the regulation of utilities, so cannot comment on whether this arrangement complies with those laws.&nbsp; You may wish to contact the appropriate regulator, just to make sure.</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Oregon Landlord-Tenant Law</span></strong>.&nbsp; In general, I know of no specific laws that would be <em>directly violated</em> by such agreements. &nbsp;Cable services are covered under the law as “utilities.”&nbsp; Accordingly, ORS 90.532 governs, and you should review it.&nbsp; I am assuming by your question, that the cable company has the right to contact the park residents and market their services.&nbsp; Your question does not mention any costs to the park, so I assume the monthly service would be charged directly to the residents, if they choose to subscribe.&nbsp; It is important that you become familiar with the subscription policies and fees, especially whether they are consistent with those provided outside the park.&nbsp; Remember that you will be giving the company a “captive audience” and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to terminate the service, once you are under contract.&nbsp; Will the marketing occur before installation of the infrastructure.&nbsp; Will there be any minimum number of subscribers?&nbsp; Will rates change and if so, could residents demand you change companies because their rates are not competitive?&nbsp; How easily may the residents terminate their subscription services?</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you currently provide some type of cable service, either from this company or another, what is your billing arrangement?&nbsp; If it is buried in the base rent, you may have to deal with whether you should treat this arrangement like a utility “conversion,” such that you must pull the charge out of your base rent, so that the residents are not double-billed.</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Park Documents</span></strong>.&nbsp; What do your rules and rental agreements say?&nbsp; Is there anything in them that could run afoul of the agreements the company is asking you to sign?&nbsp; While nothing specific comes to mind that could pose a problem, the best way to avoid the unexpected is to verify that there is no risk of some violation of the park documents by the cable agreements, or vice versa.&nbsp;</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">General Observations</span></strong>.

Why does the company want it?&nbsp; I suspect they don’t want parks “comparing notes” on the deal they cut with their company.&nbsp; While that is understandable, it poses the risk of inadvertent disclosure.&nbsp; What is the “penalty” for disclosure?&nbsp; Do you have to refund the initial payment made?&nbsp; If so, does that mean the deal is over, or does the remainder of the agreement survive – that is, does the company still have the exclusive right to provide services in the park?&nbsp; I think I would like to see some language which penalized only intentional or willful disclosures (assuming you have any ability at all to negotiate some of these terms).</li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>I assume the company will own all of the equipment.</strong>&nbsp; Are there certain limitations on their ability to come and go inside the park?&nbsp; Specifically, is there a risk of noise, inconvenience, traffic issues, etc?&nbsp; How long will installation take?&nbsp; Will the park grounds be restored to their original condition?&nbsp; Again, remember, once these agreements are signed, you’re at the company’s mercy on what they do.&nbsp; Make sure their reputation for service and cooperation is good.&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>What is the term of the agreement?</strong> I suspect it contains a provision for automatic renewal, absent one party or the other giving notice of termination?&nbsp; While that is fair, you have to carefully read the agreements to see if there is any right to terminate without cause.&nbsp; In other words, can you get out of the deal “just because,” or does there have to be a breach?&nbsp; </li></ul> <p class=""ListParagraph"" style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p> <ul style=""text-align: justify;""><li><strong>If either side terminates does the initial payment have to be returned to the company?</strong>&nbsp; If so, you might consider making that payment “nonrefundable” after a certain length of time, say five years.&nbsp; You want to make sure that if the agreements become unenforceable due to some law or similar situation over which you have no control, that you do not have to refund the money.&nbsp;

"112","112","1","MHCO Legislative Update (6-21-2011): Senate Passes Coalition Bill (SB 294) - Legislative Adjournment Near","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 2011 Oregon Legislative Session is in its final days. Sometime later this week the gavel will fall and the 2011 Legislative Session will be history. Legislators have until June 30th to adjourn, in accordance with an annual legislative sessions law passed by Oregon voters in 2010. Legislators will return in February for a brief session and then on to the 2012 election.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Earlier this month the Senate unanimously passed SB 294 - the landlord-tenant coalition bill. This piece of legislation was the result of 19 meetings each lasting 3 hours held over the past two years. MHCO's President Adam Cook, MHCO Legislative Chair Troy Brost, Dale Strom, Ed Bartholemy and myself attended all the meetings. A great deal of time was spent discussing water sub-metering in manufactured home communities. In 2009 the Oregon Legislature passed a bill that required all communities with more than 199 spaces to sub-meter water.   As a result of that legislation a significant portion of the landlord-tenant coalition was spent working out the problems with the 2009 sub-metering bill. Specially, MHCO set out to prevent the legislature from passing mandatory water sub-metering in every manufactured home community in Oregon. Mandatory water sub-metering for all manufactured home communities in Oregon would have been devastating to many community owners. The coalition bill (SB 294) addresses water sub-metering and clarifies the process community owners are to follow if they <strong><em>VOLUNTARILY</em></strong> decide to sub-mater water in their communities.  <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Maintaining voluntary water sub-metering was a top legislative goal for MHCO and SB 294 accomplished that goal.</span></strong> The bill also addresses the conversion of a manufactured home community to a sub division.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">MHCO attorney, Phil Querin, will provide an analysis and guide to converting to water sub-metering which will be posted at MHCO.ORG later this month.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Overall this was a very good legislative session for owners of manufactured home communities. In January  MHCO set out to defeat several particularly bad pieces of legislation. <strong>HB 2172</strong> and <strong>HB 3183</strong> pertained to rent control in Oregon and both were defeated. An attempt to give the Oregon Attorney General enforcement powers to regulate landlord-tenant law in manufactured home communities was defeated. <strong>SB 85</strong> which would have required all community owners selling a home in their community to establish an escrow account for each home was amended by MHCO and OMHA (Oregon Manufactured Housing Association - Don Miner) to keep this requirement from becoming law. Finally, as mentioned above - MHCO was very concerned that the Legislature would move to make all manufactured home communities sub-meter water. MHCO succeeded in making sure that such a requirement <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">did not pass.</span></strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">There were many other proposals that had hearings but did not move out of committee. The requirement to provide voter registration cards <strong>(HB 2885)</strong> to all new residents; a proposal <strong>(SB 507)</strong> requiring new antenna system in housing provided by landlords; notification of school district by landlord when an education provider is evicted <strong>(HB 2029)</strong> - just to name a few of the ""bad"" bills - were defeated or substantially amended.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Although there was a ""rent control"" hearing in late May, the bill (HB 3183), community owners filled two hearings rooms.  This ended up being a great opportunity to educate legislators on the perils of government regulated rent.  This threat is not going away, it will surface again in the future, but we did make significant impact. &nbsp;Thanks to all who attended the hearing. &nbsp;Showing up does make a difference.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The success of this legislative session really belongs to the many community owners and managers who took the time to send an e-mail to the appropriate Legislator or Committee Member. Thank you to all of you who cared enough to take the time to compose a thoughtful e-mail. Legislators repeatedly mentioned that they were getting e-mails from MHCO members. In a meeting with Co-Speaker Hanna, Adam Cook and myself noticed a folder 2 inches thick with MHCO member e-mails. That is a great accomplishment - <strong>Thank You!</strong></p>","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The 2011 Oregon Legislative Session is in its final days.

"126","126","1","Sub Letting Eviction","Question: An occupant lives in a home that is sub leased from her father. The father, who is the official tenant on the lease, does not live in the home.  The occupant has been in the house since the beginning of January.  The occupant was asked at the time to complete and submit a criminal background check, but refused. So the occupant is living there as an unauthorized person. The father has given the occupant (his daughter) an eviction notice.  They went to court, and the judge told them to come back in two weeks. This morning the occupant gave the community owner a money order for February rent.  What should the community owner do with the money order. Should it be returned?  Should the community owner issue a 24 hour notice since the occupant is there without another person in the home having signed a rental agreement?  Or should the community owner give a no cause eviction?

Answer:  This fact patter should be a cautionary tale for all park owners and managers about the risk of letting too much time elapse between the violation and legal action.  In order to fully answer the question, I need to assume certain facts.  First, I assume that the rules clearly do not permit one to occupy a home without management approval.  Secondly, I assume that some form of permitted subleasing is OK, so long as the subtenant is approved by management.  Third, I assume that someone – presumably the father – has been paying the rent.  

If rent has been accepted with knowledge of this violation, it would be deemed to have been waived after the second acceptance of rent – regardless of who paid it.  Clearly, if the rules prohibit this, as does the rental agreement and law, action should have been taken the moment she refused to cooperate.  

The best solution may be for the father to proceed with the eviction, since he is a “landlord” under the non-manufactured housing side of the Landlord-Tenant law.  Clearly, he can work it out with her and/or the court, better than management working with the recalcitrant occupant, who has already established her unwillingness to cooperate.  Besides, why should the park absorb this expense, when it is really between the father as a “landlord” and his daughter as the “tenant.”  (I don’t know why the judge sent them home, but suspect it was to try to resolve it as a family matter rather than a court matter.) 

As for whether to accept the rent, it’s already pretty late to be worried about “waiver” since that has long since been confirmed to have occurred.  Nevertheless, I would NOT accept the rent until this matter is resolved.  

The problem with park management doing the eviction based upon an “unauthorized occupant,” violation, is that it’s too late to enforce, in my opinion.  However, your question about a “No-cause” eviction suggests that you believe this might be a viable alternative – i.e. the legal basis for eviction arises under the non-manufactured housing side of the statutes.  I don’t think so.  First, because the manufactured housing side of the law still applies vis a vis the father, and regardless, rent has been accepted, making the waiver argument a real possibility.

"132","132","1","Manufactured Housing Communities and the 55+ Older Market","People are now living long after retirement.  According to the  2007 period life table for the Social Security area population,  those on the cusp of retirement, ages 55‐64, are expected to  live on average 21.34 more years.  Living in a manufactured  home community represents an ideal lifestyle choice for many  in this demographic.  The following represents some real  advantages that manufactured homes offer the 55+ market:  
  
‐ Manufactured homes can be customized to fit the  needs and wants of every homebuyer.  This includes  interior floor plans, exterior designs and custom  kitchens, baths and living areas.  
‐ Manufactured housing, especially those located in  land‐lease communities, are less expensive to  purchase and maintain.  
‐ Manufactured homes offer convenient one‐story  living and can be built for accessibility.  
‐  Manufactured home communities provide a unique  setting where smaller yards require less maintenance,  while individual home sites maximize privacy.   
‐ Manufactured home communities provide a secure,  friendly, relaxed environment with a strong sense of  ‘community’.  
  
How can manufactured housing communities benefit 55+?  
  
Manufactured housing communities allow residents to own  their own home while leasing the land, thus eliminating the  expense of property taxes and allowing homeowners to enjoy  amenities and well‐maintained common areas.  According to  a report prepared for the Commission of Affordable Housing  and Health Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st Century,  advantages of land‐lease properties are that “the resident can  own the home with a lower down‐payment than virtually any  
other housing alternative because the cost of land is not  included in the transaction. The resident can also benefit from  appreciation, provided the home is well maintained in a well‐ located and maintained park.”    

In addition, and no less important, is the sense of community  engendered by the manufactured home lifestyle.   By  providing many opportunities for social interaction through  organized activities, such as clubs, fitness classes and social  events, communities encourage resident relationships.     Safety and security are top concerns for many residents.   Many 55+ communities are gated and provide on‐site security  as well as neighborhood watch programs.  By providing a  sense of security,  spaces to personalize, interesting  destinations and places to walk, and the options of having  pets, manufactured home communities have the potential of  
encouraging active living for 55+ individuals.  
  
What can community owners offer to attract the 55+ market? 
  
Age restricted manufactured housing communities,  typically  called 55+, offer many advantages with many different types  of land‐lease communities to choose from.  They can be large  communities with numerous amenities or smaller and more  affordable family‐owned communities.  There are  communities located all over the country and in every price  range.  Common amenities include swimming pools,  clubhouses, health clubs, and tennis courts.  
  
We know that most people begin their housing search online.   To capture the attention of those  looking online at housing  options, 55+ manufactured home communities need to have  attractive websites that provide lots of information, including  pictures of the community (not just individual homes),  information about lease fees, and testimonials from  homeowners.   In addition, an attractive and informative  website should highlight those services and amenities that are  important and attractive to seniors.  Jensen Communities  (www.jensencommunities.com), offers a great example of a  website that is user‐friendly. In addition to outlining  important information related to the advantages of living in a  manufactured home, the website provides prospective residents with a comprehensive list of special amenities found  in their communities.    

Jim Ayotte, Executive Director of the  Florida Manufactured Housing Association, states,  “to make  an emotional connection with prospective homebuyers, every  community’s website should have a detailed description of  their value proposition, with quality pictures of homes and  individuals.  Homeowner testimonials are a great idea.”    With over 900 55+ manufactured home communities, Florida  represents a top destination choice for many.  In Mr. Ayotte’s  view, the range of options available in Florida’s 55+  communities is limitless.   Those in the 55+ market are  undoubtedly attracted to Florida’s warm climate, sandy  beaches, suburban or rural settings (depending on  preferences), excellent health care and affordable cost of  living.  Many of Florida’s 55+ manufactured housing  communities have swimming pools, community centers,  health clubs, tennis courts and executive or professional golf  courses.  Seniors are looking not just to buy a home but to buy  
into a lifestyle.  Ayotte also explained that he expects the 55+  community industry to expand over the next ten years as the  baby‐boomer generation reaches  retirement age.  Experts  have indicated that baby‐boomers are very active and many  are expected to continue working after they retire.  Community owners that focus on the 55+ market need to be  poised to meet the unique needs of this large demographic.  
  
Manufactured home communities continue to be a popular  option for a growing segment of the aging U.S. baby boomer  generation.  In the last decade, the median age of the nation  has increased from 35.3 to 37.2 – an all‐time high as  determined by the U.S. Census Bureau.  In 2010, 17.3 percent  of Florida’s population was age 65 or higher.  This trend is  expected to continue as more seniors flock to Florida and  other warm weather retirement destinations.  For seniors, 55+ manufactured home communities provide an affordable  housing choice with great lifestyle advantages.  Clearly, this  niche market is a great opportunity for seniors and  community owners alike.

TENANT may terminate this tenancy upon a minimum of 30 days’ written notice to LANDLORD.  If such notice is given, TENANT agrees to either: (a) Remove TENANT’S Home from the Space by the termination date in the Notice; or, (b) Resell the Home on site to a purchaser approved by LANDLORD by the termination date.  Once TENANT’S 30-day notice is given, LANDLORD shall not be required to permit TENANT to remain at the Space beyond the 30 day period stated in the notice, even if LANDLORD has not yet found another tenant for the Space.  TENANT will be held responsible for any damage caused to the Community by removal of the Home and accessories.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">B.	By LANDLORD. LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy under the following circumstances:</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">(1)	TENANT or others occupying TENANT'S Home violate a law or ordinance which relates to TENANT’S conduct as a tenant or violates this Agreement or the Community Rules and Regulations.  TENANT may avoid such termination by correcting the specified violation within 30 days or such longer time provided in the notice from LANDLORD describing the violation.  If substantially the same violation reoccurs within 6 months following the date of issuance of the first notice, LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy by giving TENANT a non-curable 20-day written notice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">(2)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy by giving 72 hours' written notice of nonpayment if TENANT fails to pay rent within 7 days after rent becomes due, or 144 hours written notice of nonpayment if TENANT fails to pay rent within 4 days after the rent becomes due.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">(3)	LANDLORD has given TENANT three or more notices for nonpayment of rent within the previous 12 months. LANDLORD may terminate this Agreement by giving TENANT not less than 30 days’ notice in writing concurrent with or after the third or subsequent notice for nonpayment of rent within the previous 12 months.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">(4)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy after 24 hours’ written notice specifying the cause if, among other reasons, (a) the TENANT, someone in the TENANT'S control or the TENANT'S pet seriously threatens to inflict substantial personal injury, or inflicts any substantial personal injury, upon a person on the premises other than the TENANT; (b) The TENANT or someone in the TENANT'S control recklessly endangers a person on the premises other than the TENANT by creating a serious risk of substantial personal injury; (c) The TENANT, someone in the TENANT'S control or the TENANT'S pet inflicts any substantial personal injury upon a neighbor living in the immediate vicinity of the premises; (d)  The TENANT or someone in the TENANT'S control intentionally inflicts any substantial damage to the premises or the TENANT'S pet inflicts substantial damage to the premises on more than one occasion; (e)(A) The TENANT intentionally provided substantial false information on the application for the tenancy within the past year; (B) The false information was with regard to a criminal conviction of the TENANT that would have been material to the LANDLORD'S acceptance of the application; and (C) The LANDLORD terminates the rental agreement within 30 days after discovering the falsity of the information; (f) The TENANT has vacated the premises, the person in possession is holding contrary to a written rental agreement that prohibits subleasing the premises to another or allowing another person to occupy the premises without the written permission of the LANDLORD, and the LANDLORD has not knowingly accepted rent from the person in possession; or (g)  The TENANT, someone in the TENANT'S control or the TENANT'S pet commits any act that is outrageous in the extreme, on the premises or in the immediate vicinity of the premises.</p>

"133","133","3","Landlord's Right To Enter Home","Question: In this situation, the landlord (i.e., community owner) owns the manufactured home located on a space in the park.  The resident gave a 30-day notice earlier in the month.  Rent was paid to the 10th day of the following month. The resident left the home, taking his belongings, but claims he will be back to clean the home up and collect his $400 cleaning deposit.  However, the electric company is coming out to shut off the power because the resident owes them for unpaid bills.  The landlord is concerned about the pipes freezing, since the local temperatures at night drops into the low 20s.  What are the landlord's rights as far as entering the home?  Specifically, what can the landlord do to save the pipes?  Can the landlord have the electric bill changed to his/her name, enter the property and turn on the heat and power and then turn it off during the day?  Where is this covered in the Oregon Revised Statutes?  Can the landlord apply the $400 toward funds advance toward the electric bill?

Answer:  Under this scenario, the landlord is also the owner of the home, so under certain circumstances, access would be permitted.  Under the manufactured housing side of the landlord-tenant law, where the tenant owns the home, I would say that the only right of access – even in an emergency – is to the space itself and not the interior of the home.  It would only be following the landlord’s declaration of an abandonment under ORS 90.675, that he/she would have a right to enter the home itself.  Until that right arises, I would probably advise the landlord to stay out of the tenant’s home under almost any circumstances, since there is no provision under the manufactured housing side of the law that permits such entry where the tenant owns the home.

In our present case, the landlord also owns the home, so his/her rights are the same as any other landlord of an apartment or other rental unit.  A landlord’s right of access where the landlord owns the home, would be found in ORS 90.322  

90.322(1)(b) deals with emergency access:

In case of an emergency, a landlord may enter the dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant’s exclusive control without consent of the tenant, without notice to the tenant and at any time. ""Emergency"" includes but is not limited to a repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious damage to the premises. If a landlord makes an emergency entry in the tenant’s absence, the landlord shall give the tenant actual notice within 24 hours after the entry, and the notice shall include the fact of the entry, the date and time of the entry, the nature of the emergency and the names of the persons who entered. [Underscore added. - PCQ] 

As for the application of the security deposit, I’m afraid it’s a little more complicated than simply applying it toward monies expended to keep the electricity on.  Your question called it a “cleaning deposit.”  If that is how it was designated, it suggests that it may be applied only toward cleaning of the home.  The better term to use in the rental agreement is “security deposit” which is designed to “secure the tenant’s performance under the rental agreement.”  If the rental agreement required that the tenant keep all such utility charges current, then the breach of that provision would entitle the landlord to apply the deposit toward the expenditure of funds to remedy the breach. The security deposit statute is ORS 90.300, and is helpful to read, as it addresses the landlord’s duty to account to the tenant for the expenditure of funds within 31 days following termination of the tenancy, or the tenant’s departure, if later than the termination.

<pre>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under current state law, if a manufactured dwelling park, or a portion of the park that includes the space for a manufactured dwelling, is to be closed and the land or leasehold converted to a use other than as a manufactured dwelling park (and the closure is not required by the exercise of eminent domain or by order of federal, state or local agencies) the landlord may terminate a month-to-month or fixed term rental agreement for a manufactured dwelling park space by giving tenants not less than 365 days' notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination and by paying tenants one of the following amounts for their dwelling: (a) $5,000 if it is a single-wide; (b) $7,000 if it is a double-wide; or (c) $9,000 if it is a triple-wide or larger. &nbsp;Certain local jurisdictions in Oregon may have ordinances that provide increased benefits and/or money to tenants located in a manufactured dwelling park that is closing.&nbsp; Our policy is the same. You are encouraged to review ORS Chapter 90 (Oregon’s landlord-tenant law) and your local city or county ordinances regarding park closure, or have an expert do so on your behalf before entering into your tenancy. We have no current plans to close all or any portion of the Community, but this could change in the future.</pre>

"142","142","3","Medical Marijuana and Landlord Rights","Question: Our community is seeing an increase in the use of “medical” marijuana.  Although those using it say they have “cards” permitting them to grow limited amounts, often this limited personal use appears to turn into more than that.  We are noticing increasing late night traffic at some users’ homes, and believe they are expanding their grow operations in order to sell the marijuana to unauthorized users. What can be done about this?  It is quite disruptive to the rest of our community.

Answer: A good discussion and summary of Oregon’s medical marijuana law is found at the following link: http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/medicalmarijuanaprogram/Pages/index.aspx  

The Oregon statutes are located at this link: http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/MedicalMarijuanaProgram/Documents/statutes.pdf

Here are the Oregon administrative rules:
http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/MedicalMarijuanaProgram/Documents/rules.pdf 

As you can no doubt see, these laws and rules are focused primarily on legal marijuana use, rather than illegal use.  Although Oregon’s landlord-tenant law has a statute giving a landlord the right to issue a 24-hour notice to residents engaged in the manufacture, delivery or possession of controlled substances, it does not include “The medical use of marijuana in compliance with ORS 475.300 to 475.346.”

In order to evict the offending resident(s), the difficulty is trying to prove that the resident is actually manufacturing, deliverying, or possessing marijuana in violation of the law.  This is particularly tough since the landlord cannot gain access to the interior of the home or the backyard. (If the backyard is concealed by a high fence, I would probably not advise a landlord to take pictures or view the area by using a ladder or other similar means.  Leave that for the police.

All in all, I have three suggestions: (a) Go the police and see if you can enlist their help in stopping this activity; (b) Find out how to start a neighborhood watch program that will discourage persons driving in to buy drugs; (c) Carefully and patiently begin tracking neighbor complaints of late night activity that causes a disturbance to the other neighbors.  Begin by first contacting the offending resident by phone or a personal visit, politely asking that the activity cease.  If it continues, write a letter (not a termination notice).  If it continues, then issue a 30-day termination notice for violation of ORS 90.740(3)(i), which requires that tenants “Behave, and require persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave, in a manner that does not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors.”  

Once this notice is given, if the conduct stops within the 30 days, you may re-issue a second notice with a 20-day non-curable termination if it re-occurs with 6 months following issuance of the first 30-day curable notice.  I prefer this approach, since the landlord is not required to “prove” that the resident was actually engaging in the manufacture, delivery or possession of marijuana.  All you need to do is establish the circumstances giving rise to the disruption and that it is interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of the other residents.  The judge or jury will be able to “connect the dots.”

<p>Pursuant to House Bill 2614 (“the Bill”), enacted by the 2009 Oregon Legislature, this Floodplain Notice is being provided to you because some or all of the Space upon which your dwelling has been placed is located within a 100-year flood plain.&nbsp; A “100-year floodplain” refers to the level that flood waters may be expected to equal or exceed once each 100 years as determined by the National Flood Insurance Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”).</p>
<p>According to the Bill, we are now required to notify you of this fact.&nbsp; Having complied with this new law means that we are not responsible to you for any uninsured loss you may incur due to flooding.&nbsp; We suggest that if you do not currently have flood insurance you may wish to explore the possibility of obtaining it in order to provide some financial protection in the event you incur any damage as a result of a flood.&nbsp; Oregon law does not require that we provide you with flood insurance.</p>

The rent is to be space specific – not an average of rent in the community.

"420","420","3","Submeter Your Community at Zero Out of Pocket Landlord Expense","By Troy Brost 
Owner SongBrook MHC, Eugene, 
Past President and Legislative Chair of Manufactured Housing Communities of Oregon


The title of this Community Update should have caught your attention.  It is not a gimmick, I have done it myself.  Adam Cook's MHCO Community Update article, ""Can You Afford to Keep Utilities Included in Your Rent?"" from last week is spot on!  My answer is no, I cannot and no longer do"".

Both Landlords and Tenants agree of the importance of sub-metering; it is a win-win proposition.  Enduring years of Landlord/Tenant Coalition, one of the most daunting tasks was demonstrating Landlords do not have safes' locked full of money.  Financing options simply did not exist to fund mandatory sub-metering.  Where were Landlords to find upwards of $750+ per homesite to install water sub-meters?  Of course, Landlords proved their argument and negotiated the right to unilaterally amend rental agreements to permit community-wide sub-metering; creating provisions to recapture installation expenses by billing Tenants.  Considering a new program now available, I believe every Landlord should sub-meter sooner than later!  

Now available is a sub-meter and installation program at zero expense to any Landlord wanting to install new or replace old sub-meter systems.  No applications, no qualifications, and no money down gets you state of the art wireless monitored sub-meters (water, electric, and gas are all available).  What's the catch? ... the Landlord signs a 10 year Billing Agreement with the provider, in which the Tenant pays.  So, how does it work?

First, the meters are purchased/installed/administered/maintained/repaired/monitored/insured/read/etc. by an Independent 3rd party.  Just as all meter reading companies, this 3rd party charges a monthly fee for their service ... it is their cost of doing business.  In Eugene, this 3rd party charges nearly 1/2 less of what EWEB (Eugene Water and Electric Board) charges it's customers.  Second, per ORS 90, the 3rd party bills the Tenant the cost of the sub-meter and installation over a minimum of 60 months.  The sub-metering process is complicated; no worries, this 3rd party is experienced, has been in business for nearly a decade, has all the systems and sample notices in place, and handles the entire process on behalf of the Landlord.  

The Bottom line:  local government agencies and utility companies use Landlords to pass through their exorbitant ""fees"" and rate increases, in which Landlords are forced to carry until the next ""rent"" increase ... making the Landlord the greedy bad guy.  Prior to sub-metering, utility expenses were 23% of my rent; my monthly invoices now line item sub-meter every utility possible.  My rents are now very competitive within the market and I have direct control over costs.  I see every reason why all Landlords should do the same.

Indeed, it sounds too good to be true ... it is.  Contact me at troybrost@gmail.com, 541-554-1499, or visit www.infrasystems.us to find out for yourself.  I will provide you with the contact and information you need and assist you along the way.

<p>NAME OF APPLICANT: ____________________________ ADDRESS: _________________</p>
<p>SPACE: ______ &nbsp;CITY: __________________ &nbsp; STATE: ________ &nbsp;ZIP: ______ &nbsp; TELEPHONE: ____________</p>
<p><em>Explanation:  Under the Fair Housing Act (“the Act”) landlords are required to make reasonable accommodations to the rented facilities and common areas, if so requested by a handicapped tenant or their legal occupant.  This law applies to the use of assistance animals.  A “reasonable accommodation” is a reasonable change, exception or adjustment to a rule, policy practice or service that will enable a handicapped person to have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the rented facilities and common areas.  There must be an identifiable relationship between the requested accommodation and the person’s disability.  Landlords are not required to make requested accommodations if doing so would impose an undue financial or administrative burden upon them or fundamentally alter the nature of the landlord’s operations.  Landlords are entitled to obtain information that is necessary to evaluate a request for a reasonable accommodation.  With respect to a person, a “handicap” means: (a) one with a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities; (b) one with a record of such impairment; or (c) one who is regarded as having such an impairment.  Juvenile offenders, sex offenders, persons who illegally use controlled substances and those with a disability whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to others, or result in substantial physical damage to the property of others, are generally not protected under the Act. If the landlord refuses a requested accommodation, the requester is encouraged to have a discussion with the landlord concerning an alternative accommodation. This is a summary only and not intended to constitute legal advise.  For more information, landlords, tenants and legal occupants of tenants are encouraged to consult with their attorney or a Fair Housing expert if they have any questions regarding their rights and responsibilities.</em></p>
<p>1.	Description of accommodation requested:____________________________________________________</p>
<p>2.	Please describe the relationship between the disability and the requested accommodation (<em>Note: You are not required to identify your specific disability or its severity.

<p><em>_______________________________________________________________________________________</em></p>
<p>3.	Please provide the name, address and phone number of those who are in position to know about and verify the disability and/or the need for the requested accommodation.  Such persons may include treating physicians or other medical professionals, peer support group, non-medical service agencies, or reliable third parties who are in a position to know.  I hereby authorize landlord or landlord’s management to contact said person(s) and obtain such information as may be necessary to make the appropriate verification. <strong>See Page 2</strong> <em>(Note: This information needs to be completed only if (a) the disability is not known or readily apparent to the landlord or (b) the need for the requested accommodation is not known or readily apparent to the landlord.):&nbsp;</em>_____________________________________</p>

<p>Name of Resident:_________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.	The animal shall be on a leash at all times when outside of Resident's home.  Resident shall be fully responsible for cleaning up after their animal when outside the home.  This shall include but not be limited to prompt removal of all feces, droppings, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.	The animal shall not cause any sort of nuisance, damage (physical or property) or disturbance to other Residents, their guests, or to any other third parties who are in the Community with the knowledge and/or consent of Management or other Residents or guests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.	Resident shall be liable for any loss, damage claims, or liability, including attorney fees (collectively ""damages""), directly or indirectly caused by the animal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.	This Assistance Animal Agreement is hereby incorporated into Resident's Rental Agreement.  In the event of a breach of this Assistance Animal Agreement, Management shall have the right to levy a fine of $______ for the first violation, $______ for the second violation and $______ for the third violation.  (Note: (a) No fine may exceed $50, and (b) No fine may be assessed under this Section 4., unless such a fine would apply to all residents in this Community for the same violation.)   All fines must be paid within ten (10) days.  Notwithstanding the preceding, in the event of breach of this Assistance Animal Agreement, Management reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to: (a) immediately terminate this Assistance Animal Agreement and demand removal of the animal and/or (b) terminate the Rental Agreement in accordance with ORS 90.630 or 90.400.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5.	Except as otherwise provided under applicable Federal and State Fair Housing Laws, this Assistance Animal Agreement shall not be construed to modify or amend the terms of the Community rules, regulations or rental agreement with Resident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:  Under Federal and State Fair Housing Laws, Management is required to make reasonable accommodations if you are handicapped as defined by law.  If you have a handicap that requires your use of an assistance animal, and you believe that one or more of the above requirement should not apply to you, you may request that an accommodation be made.  The form of the request may be on a Reasonable Accommodation Request (MHCO Form #15) or in any other reasonable format you would like to provide.  Landlords are entitled to obtain reasonable information in order to assist in determining whether the requested accommodation is reasonably necessary because of the disability. However, if a person’s disability is obvious, or otherwise known to the landlord, and if the need for the requested accommodation is readily apparent or known, then the landlord may not seek any additional information about that disability or the disability-related need for the accommodation.</em></strong></p>

<p>A. <strong>By TENANT</strong>.  If this is a month-to-month tenancy, TENANT may terminate this tenancy upon a minimum of 30 days’ written notice to LANDLORD.  If such a notice is given, TENANT agrees to vacate no later than the date of termination of tenancy provided in the 30 day notice.  Once TENANT'S 30-day notice is given, LANDLORD shall not be required to permit TENANT to remain at the Space beyond the 30 day period stated in the notice, even if LANDLORD has not yet found another tenant for the Home or Space.</p>
<p>B. <strong>By LANDLORD</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy, without cause, upon a minimum of 30 days' written notice to TENANT.</p>
<p>(2)	If this is a month-to month tenancy, and TENANT has occupied the Premise for one year or less, LANDLORD may terminate TENANT’S tenancy without cause by giving not less than thirty (30) days’ advance written notice.

<p>(3)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy upon a minimum of 30 days'  written notice to TENANT, if TENANT or others occupying the Home violate a law or ordinance which relates to TENANT'S conduct as a tenant or violates this Agreement or the Community Rules and Regulations.  TENANT may avoid such terminate by correcting the specified violation within 14 days or such longer time provided in the notice from LANDLORD describing the violation.  If substantially the same violation reoccurs within 6 months following the date of issuance of the first notice, LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy by giving TENANT a non-curable 10 day written notice.</p>
<p>(4)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy by giving 72 hours' written notice of nonpayment if TENANT fails to pay rent within 7 days after rent becomes due, or 144 hours written notice of nonpayment if TENANT fails to pay rent within 4 days after the rent becomes due.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This Manufactured Home Storage Agreement (With Lienholder) (Form 35A) is to be used only those situations in which the home has been legally abandoned and the Landlord is attempting to resell, dispose or destroy of the home through the abandonment process as more fully described in Oregon Revised Statutes 90.425 and 90.675.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This Form 35A should <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span> be used without having first commenced a legal abandonment in accordance with Oregon law.&nbsp; This form should <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span> be entered into between the Landlord and Lienholder where the 45-day letter has not been sent to the tenant’s last known address, with copies to all other persons (including the Lienholder) required by law to receive it.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the Landlord has properly initiated an abandonment pursuant to ORS 90.425 and/or 90.675, the Manufactured Home Storage Agreement (With Lienholder) (Form 35A) may be used.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE ABANDONMENT STATUTES, ORS 90.425 and 90.675, ARE COMPLICATED AND REQUIRE LANDLORDS TO FULLY COMPLETE A SERIES OF STEPS WHICH, IF NOT PROPERLY FOLLOWED COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS LEGAL LIABILITY TO LANDLORDS AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS OR OTHERS INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS.&nbsp; FOR THIS REASON, MHCO STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT LANDLORDS SEEK COMPETENT ADVICE FROM A LAWYER FAMILIAR WITH THIS SPECIALIZED AREA OF THE LAW <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">BEFORE</span> COMMENCING ANY ABANDONMENT OF A MANUFACTURED DWELLING.</strong></p>

<p>This Agreement is entered by and between ________________________ (hereinafter ""Landlord"") and ___________________________ (hereinafter ""Lienholder"") relating to the disposition of the manufactured home described below, currently located at <strong>[token user user:profile_park]</strong>&nbsp;(hereinafter the Community”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.	General.</strong> This Agreement is for the storage of the following manufactured home (Insert year, make, model, and plate number, if available) __________________________________________________________________ (""the Home"") located at (site address and/or space number) __________________________________________________________________. The former resident(s), _________________________________________________ has/have abandoned the Home and Landlord has commenced an abandonment proceeding pursuant to ORS 90.675.  Lienholder represents the following: (a) Lienholder had a valid and enforceable lien against the Home which it has foreclosed; (b) Lienholder desires to exercise its rights to resell the Home within the Community or to remove it from the Community, all in accordance with ORS 90.675; and (c) This Agreement shall not be considered in any way to create a landlord/tenant relationship under any State or Federal laws, ordinances or regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.	Resale of Home Within Community.</strong> Lienholder shall have up to twelve (12) months to market the home within the Community for resale to a Landlord-approved purchaser.  In approving or disapproving any prospective purchaser/tenant, Landlord shall have the right to apply all screening criteria currently used for resales by existing tenants in the Community and in all other respects the applicable provisions of the Oregon Landlord Tenant Act shall apply to the transaction.  No one shall be permitted to occupy the Home until it has been sold, title has been transferred, and the new purchaser has signed all applicable Community documents including a current Statement of Policy, a current Rental or Lease Agreement and the current Rules and Regulations.  Lienholder, and/or Lienholder’s agents shall be solely responsible for making all arrangements to show the Home to prospective purchasers.  Lienholder agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of its agent to endeavor to keep the Community manager apprised as to the dates and times prospective purchasers will be entering the Community to inspect the Home.  At the time of closing of a sale of the Home to the Landlord-approved purchaser, Landlord shall be paid, in full, for all storage charges and other sums due Landlord under this Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.	Maintenance and Repair.</strong> Lienholder covenants and agrees to keep clean and to maintain the space and Home in a manner consistent with the rights and obligations described in the leases or rental agreements currently provided to other tenants in Community.  The Lienholder shall repair any defects in the Home that existed prior to the date of this Agreement if the defects and necessary repairs are reasonably described in this Agreement.  If the Home was first placed in the Community within 24 months prior to the date of this Agreement, the repairs must be reasonably consistent with the Community standards in effect at the time of placement.  All repairs noted herein shall be completed within 90 days after the date Lienholder signs this Agreement.  Notwithstanding Section 5, below, the failure to make necessary repairs described below within said 90 days shall entitle Landlord to terminate this Agreement with not less than 14 days’ advance written Notice of Default stating facts sufficient to notify Lienholder of the reason for termination.  Upon termination, Landlord may sell or dispose of the Home without further notice to the Lienholder.  Provided, however, this Agreement shall not terminate if Lienholder corrects the violation within the 14 days or such longer period as provided in the Notice of Default.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.	Storage Charges</strong>.  The current monthly storage charge is $___________.  The monthly storage charge is due, in advance, on the first day of each month that the Home remains in the Community.  This Agreement has been included in Lienholder’s copy of the 45-day Notice of Abandonment letter sent to the above-identified tenants and was mailed on the date appearing on that letter.  Accordingly, Lienholder’s first storage charge payment to Landlord shall include charges accruing from the date of the 45-day letter together with the storage charge for the current month. Storage charges may be prorated for all periods of less than one full month. Storage charges may also include utility or service charges for electricity, water, sewer services and natural gas if incidental to the storage of the Home.  Storage fees shall be paid to the Community office at ____________________________________.  If a storage charge is not received by the fourth (4th) day of the month, a late charge will be assessed in the same amount as charged tenants in the Community.  Currently, late fees are $___________.  Storage charges may be increased from time-to-time if: (a) They are part of a Community-wide increase for all tenants and (b) They are preceded with the same advance written notice provided all other tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.	Default.</strong> Time is declared to be of the essence.  Subject only to Section 3, above, if Lienholder violates any terms or conditions required of it to be performed herein, Landlord may terminate this Agreement by giving not less than 90 days’ advance written Notice of Default stating facts sufficient to notify Lienholder of the reason for termination.  Upon termination, Landlord may sell or dispose of the Home without further notice to the Lienholder.  Provided, however, this Agreement shall not terminate if Lienholder corrects the violation within the 90 days or such longer period as provided in the Notice of Default.  In the event Lienholder fails to pay a storage charge after curing a prior 90-day Notice of Default from Landlord for failure to pay the storage charge, Landlord may terminate this Agreement upon the same terms and conditions as provided in this Section, except that the Notice of Default and opportunity to cure shall be reduced to 30 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.	Termination by Lienholde</strong>r.  Lienholder may terminate this Agreement and remove the Home from the Facility at any time upon giving not less than fourteen (14) days advance written notice to Landlord.

<p><strong>NOTICE TO LANDLORDS: &nbsp;</strong>THIS ADDENDUM SHOULD ONLY BE USED WHERE THE APPROPRIATE BOX HAS BEEN CHECKED AT SECTION 5 OF THE MANUFACTURED DWELLING SPACE LEASE AGREEMENT.  THE RENT FORMULA PROVIDED BELOW IS IN PLACE OF THE RENT INCREASE AGREEMENT AGREED TO BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT IN SAID LEASE AGREEMENT.  <strong>IF NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, SEEK COMPETENT LEGAL ADVICE BEFORE SIGNING</strong></p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>1.	BASE RENT</strong></p>
<p>“Base Rent” shall mean the monthly amount of space rent paid by TENANT to LANDLORD, adjusted annually as described below.  On the Commencement Date, TENANT agrees to pay Base Rent in the amount of $__________ per month together with such other additional fees, costs, charges, and deposits as provided herein, or in the Rules and Regulations.  Unless otherwise provided in writing in this Lease Agreement, the Rules and Regulations, or elsewhere, and signed by LANDLORD, all such payments, including Base Rent, shall be due and payable in advance on the first day of each month during the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>2. ADJUSTMENT FORMULA TO BASE RENT</strong></p>
<p>TENANT’S Base Rent shall be adjusted annually on the “Anniversary Date,” which is defined to mean the 1st day of the same month as the month in which this Agreement commenced, for each year of the term of this Lease Agreement.  The Base Rent shall be adjusted automatically, effective on the Anniversary Date.  LANDLORD shall provide TENANT with a minimum ninety (90) day advance written notice of the amount of the annual adjustment to the Base Rent.  If the written notice of rent increase is issued less than 90 days prior to the Anniversary Date, the rent adjustment will go into effect on the 1st day of the first month following expiration of the 90 day written notice, regardless of the fact that adjustment occurs after the Anniversary Date. The Base Rent shall be adjusted upward annually by an amount equal to the percentage increase, if any, in the Portland Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) for the previous twelve months ending 120 days prior to the Anniversary Date.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and in addition to Paragraph 1 above, LANDLORD shall have the absolute right to institute an increase in Base Rent no more frequently than once in any calendar year to recoup some or all of the cost not otherwise covered by insurance to repair or replace any Park property damaged or destroyed as the result of any act of God, terrorism, war, weather, earthquake, or other similar unanticipated event.  Written notice of such increase shall be preceded by not less than 90 days' notice.  Tenants expressly consent to this rent adjustment formula as an integral part of the Lease, and stipulate that rent increases in accordance the with formula are NOT a unilateral modification of the Lease.  We expressly consent to this rent formula.</p>
<p><strong>3. RENT INCREASE LIMITS (OPTIONAL TO LANDLORD)</strong></p>
<p>The annual adjustment to Base Rent in Section 2, above, shall not be less than <strong>(insert percentage)</strong>_______%, nor more than <strong>(insert percentage)</strong>______% of the preceding year’s Base Rent or Adjusted Base Rent.  <strong>If this provision is to apply, landlord should have tenant initials here: __________  __________</strong> Example.  Assume Base Rent is $400.00 per month.  The consumer price index increase for the previous twelve months ending 120 days prior to the Anniversary Date is 5%.  A 5% cost of living increase would translate to a $20 monthly rent increase, i.e. 5% of $400 = $20.00.  The new Adjusted Base Rent would be $420.00.   Example. Assume Base Rent is $400.00 per month.  The consumer price index increase for the previous twelve months ending 120 days prior to the Anniversary Date is 2%.  However, if 3.75% is used as the minimum annual increase, this would translate to a $15.00 monthly increase, i.e. 3.75% of $400 = $15.00.  The new Adjusted Base Rent would be $415.00. Example. Assume Base Rent is $400.00 per month.  The consumer price index increase for the previous twelve months ending 120 days prior to the Anniversary Date is 10%.  However, if 7.75% is used as the maximum annual increase, this would translate to a $31 monthly increase, i.e. 7.75% of $400 = $31.00.  The new Adjusted Base Rent would be $431.00.</p>

"177","177","3","Increasing Late Fees","Question: A landlord currently charges a $25 late fee.  She wants to increase it to $50. Can she do that and if so, what kind of notice should she give?  Also, can she change the late fee from a flat amount to a percentage (e.g. 10%) of rent?

Answer:  Here is a summary of ORS 90.260, the late fee statute.  It answers the questions posed above.

(1)	 A landlord may impose a late charge or fee, however designated, only if:
•	The rent payment is not received by the fourth day of the period for which rent is payable; and
•	There exists a written rental agreement that specifies:
o	The tenant’s obligation to pay a late charge;
o	The type and amount of the late charge; and
o	The date on which rent payments are due, and the date on which late charges become due.

(2)	The amount of any late charge may not exceed:
•	A reasonable flat amount, charged once per rental period. “Reasonable amount” means the customary amount charged by landlords for that rental market;
•	A reasonable amount, charged on a per-day basis, beginning on the fifth day of the rental period for which rent is delinquent. This daily charge may accrue every day thereafter until the rent (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only. The per-day charge may not exceed six percent of the amount of the “reasonable lat amount”, described above; or
•	Five percent of the periodic rent payment amount, charged once for each succeeding five-day period, or portion thereof, for which the rent payment is delinquent, beginning on the fifth day of that rental period and continuing until that rent payment (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only.

(3)	In periodic tenancies (e.g. month-to-month), a landlord may change the type or amount of late charge by giving 30 days’ written notice to the tenant.

(4)	A landlord may not deduct a previously imposed late charge from a current or subsequent rental period rent payment in order to make the rent payment short so as to issue a 72-hour notice of nonpayment.

(5)	A landlord may charge simple interest on an unpaid late charge at the rate allowed for judgments (9.00%) and accruing from the date the late charge is imposed.

(6)	Nonpayment of a late charge alone is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause by using a curable 30-day written notice of termination.  [Note: The landlord may identify the late charge  on the 72-hour notice of nonpayment of rent, so long as it makes clear that the tenant may cure the nonpayment notice by paying only the delinquent rent, not including any late charge.]

He wants to fix the home up and then resell it.  Does the landlord have to be a licensed plumber or electrician to do the respective work on the home?

Answer:  Yes!  It’s one thing to be performing repairs on one’s own home, and quite another to be doing so on a home intended for re-sale.  But keep in mind that in either case, the repairs have to conform to all of the specialty codes – which is a reason enough for using a licensed and bonded contractor in either event. 

From a liability standpoint, the contractor should be thoroughly vetted through the Construction Contractor’s Board.   Make sure that the contractor has no complaints or other Board action.  If the home is to be sold on an installment contract, make sure a current form of security agreement is used.  Make sure the lien is properly filed with the Department of Consumer and Business Services and appears on the title to the purchaser’s home until it is paid off.  Make sure the Bill of Sale and, if applicable, the retail installment contract, both have extensive AS-IS language, making no express warranties and disclaiming all implied warranties.  Make sure the buyer gets their own inspection of the home, inside and out, including all systems such as plumbing, electrical, HVAC, etc.  I don’t recommend letting the buyer waive the inspection – it could  come back and bite the landlord if an unknown defect is later found. The landlord wants the buyer relying on his own expert, not on anything the landlord says.  After the sale the landlord does not want any lingering liabilities.

The landlord may likely have to be licensed as a dealer under ORS 446.003(8).  Review ORS 446.616 for the rules concerning transfer of an interest in a manufactured home. Review ORS 446.611 for the rules regarding perfecting a security interest in the home.  See ORS 446.641 regarding notification to the county of a transfer of ownership in the home. The landlord should be careful to record his interest first once it is acquired – and make sure title is clear when he first receives it.  Otherwise, he may find himself trying to transfer an interest that the public records show belongs to his predecessor and/or has unreleased liens on it.

"181","181","3","Phil Querin Q&A Storage Agreement About to Expire Home Unlikely to Sell","Question: A community owner entered into a Storage Agreement on a home in early January 2011.  The agreement provides that the home must be removed by November 30th if it does not sell.  We are now approaching the end of November, and the community owner does not believe the home will be sold by the end of this month.  What’s next?  Does the community owner take the homeowner to court?  Doesn't the landlord have to give one year to the home owner?    

Answer:  There are certain facts that are missing from this question.  I will supply them and then answer.  So, let’s assume the following: (a) This is a periodic (i.e. month-to-month) tenancy; (b) The tenant has moved out of the home and it is now vacant; (c) The rents are not being paid; and lastly, let’s assume that (d) The landlord was to be paid all past-due rent from the sale proceeds.  

However, before answering the question, however, let me point out a fatal error by this landlord – and many other landlords: They don’t look at the Worst Case Scenario.  I’m sure the Storage Agreement adequately covered what was to occur upon sale.  But since we have a landlord now asking what happens if the sale does not occur by November 30, I’m led to believe the parties neglected to address (in writing) the possibility of failure.  Memo to MHCO landlords:  Written agreements with tenants should always address “the exit strategy” – i.e. what protocol kicks in if the home is not sold and not removed by November 30.

Without addressing this issue in the written Storage Agreement, we are left to figure out what Oregon law would provide under these facts.  Here’s my take:

•	On December 1, the landlord should contact the ex-tenant and demand that the home be removed.  This should be done in writing or e-mail, so it can be used later if necessary.

•	If removal does not occur promptly, the landlord must rely upon Oregon law.  Unfortunately, the law leaves landlords holding the bag if a home is abandoned.   

•	The landlord will have to determine if the tenant will voluntarily waive his abandonment rights, and if not, then he must follow the legal procedure under ORS 90.675.  If there is a lienholder on the home, the landlord will have to give them notification under the abandonment law.

•	If the landlord wants to leave the home on the site and resell it to a new tenant, that option is always available , and probably should be pursued first, rather than going down the abandonment route, which can be costly in time and money.  Care should be exercised to properly document such an arrangement, in order to avoid later complaints by the tenant that they were taken advantage of.   

In Oregon, following the formal abandonment process is the only legal way for a landlord to take control of a manufactured home if the tenant fails or refuses to remove it upon termination of the tenancy.

"182","182","3","Changing 55 and Older Status and Community Rules","Question: A landlord changed the status of the community from ""Family"" to ""55&Older"" in June.  Management did not change the rules and regulations.  However, they did advertise the community as “55&Older”; identified that status in the community’s Application Criteria; and have met the requirements of the ""80/20 Rule"".  Now the community owner is changing the rules. One of the many rule change includes altering the status of the community from ""Family"" to ""55 & Older"".  It is likely that the residents will have enough votes in the petition to vote down the rule changes.  Where does this leave the community’s ""55 & Older Status""?  Does that status actually need to be in the rules?

Answer: I believe the rule change is essential.  The reason is that it is the primary document (along with the rental agreement) that defines how the park is to operate under a 55+ regime.   Here is a brief summary of how these conversions should occur:
Currently, in order to qualify for the 55+ exemption under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1989 (“FHAA”) and the Housing for Older Persons Act (“HIPA”) of 1999, a community must comply with the following requirements:
1.	Be intended and operated for persons age 55 or over.  This intent can be met by such things as (1) The manner in which the community is described to prospective residents; (2) Advertising designed to attract prospective residents; (3) Lease or rental provisions; (4) The written rules and regulations; (5) Consistent application of the rules, regulations and procedures; (6) Actual practices; and (7) Publicly posting statements describing the facility as a 55+ community.   The age verification procedures must be updated every two years.  This means maintaining a complete file on each space, including with the tenant application updated information, circulated every two years, confirming the names and ages of all persons who are currently residing in the home.

2.	 Have at least one person who is 55 years of age or older living in at least 80% of its occupied units. This 80/20 rule is critical.   Generally, communities strive to be over 80%, since falling below 80% means immediate disqualification.  Does this mean that the 20% margin must be reserved for families with children?  The answer is “No.”  In fact, a 55+ community may strive for 100% occupancy by persons age 55 or over.  Does it mean that community management must accept otherwise qualified age 55+ applicants when the second or subsequent person occupant is 18 years of age or older?  Again, the answer is “No.”  If desired, the community may increase the age requirement for the second or subsequent occupant to 25 years, 30 years, or even 55+ years.   Similarly, the community may impose a more restrictive minimum age requirement than 55.  However, it is important for park owners and managers to make sure that all such age/occupancy requirements be properly reflected in the community’s Rules and the Statement of Policy – and be consistently applied.  
 
3.	Publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent to be operated as a 55+ community. This requirement is fairly self-explanatory.  The community must make sure that in all that it does, from its advertising, rules, rental agreements, and all other policies, it always hold itself out as a 55+ facility.  
 
4.	Comply with HUD age verification of occupancy procedures to substantiate compliance with the requirement that 80% of the facility be intended to be occupied by at least one person age 55 or over. The law provides that the following documents are considered reliable for such verification: (1) Driver’s license; (2) Birth certificate; (3) Passport; (4) Immigration card; (5) Military identification; (6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability or; (7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.  
Today, if the community can meet the HOPA requirements in all respects (not because it discriminated in getting there, but simply by attrition of family occupants and the influx of more 55+ residents), it should be permitted to do so.  The process would be fairly simple for those communities that exceed the minimum 80% floor (i.e. at least one occupant age 55 or over):  Implement a rules change to conform with the 55+ laws, combined with new published policies and age verification procedures, which confirm the community’s 55+ status.  
One caveat:  Even though the Oregon landlord-tenant law does permit rules changes to implement material modifications in the parties’ bargain, there is a risk of possible argument by families in the community, complaining that they are now limited in the pool of available buyers for their homes.  However, this risk can be remedied by “grandfathering” those family residents in, thereby permitting them to sell their homes to other families.  This assumes, of course, that by doing so, the community would not jeopardize its 80%-20% ratio.  
Before proceeding down this path, park owners are urged to contact their own legal counsel familiar with the FFHA and HOPA for advice and direction.
","Question: A landlord changed the status of the community from ""Family"" to ""55&Older"" in June.  Management did not change the rules and regulations.

Before moving into a manufactured home park/community, you must sign a receipt that you have received the attached Statement of Policy for this park. Manufactured home park/community living has many advantages that can include lower up-front capital costs, lower maintenance costs and a sense of community and security. However, there are important economic and legal consequences to a decision to locate your manufactured home on rented/leased land. You are advised to study carefully the following disclosures before placing a manufactured home on a rented/leased homesite space or buying a home located in a manufactured home park/community. This document does not address all the issues you encounter in manufactured home community living. It is intended to' help you reach an informed decision. You have the right to consult an attorney before reaching a decision and the right to shop around for the best investment.</p>
<p>1.	The attached Statement of Policy contains important matters to be considered in renting/leasing a manufactured home space.</p>
<p>2.	The Statement of Policy is only summary in nature. You should carefully read all references and all exhibits to the Statement of Policy.</p>
<p>3.	Oral representations should not be relied upon as correctly stating the representations of the park owner or manager. Refer to the Statement of Policy and its exhibits for correct representations.</p>
<p>4.	If you sign a rental agreement prior to occupancy in a manufactured home park, the agreement may or may not allow you to change your mind and cancel it during a ""cooling off"" period. Check on this.</p>
<p>5.	Rents can and do go up. The homesite space rent could increase periodically, out of proportion with your ability to pay, especially if your income is fixed. When parks are sold, rents may increase. Remember that you - not the landlord - are responsible for your ability to pay rent.</p>
<p>6.	Your tenancy may legally terminate: (a) if you fail to pay rent or you violate a law, an ordinance or the conditions of tenancy in the park; (b) if you are late with the rent payment and written notice is given three or more times within a 12 month period; (c) if the park closes; or (d) when your rental agreement/lease term expires and is not renewed.</p>
<p>7.	Occasionally, rising rents or termination of tenancy or park closure may cause homeowner to bear moving costs. Manufactured homes are not easily moved. You could have difficulty finding a place to put your home.</p>
<p>8.	You are free to terminate your tenancy and to leave the park on 30 days notice without obligation to the landlord. The landlord is free to close all or a portion of the park on 12 months notice without obligation to you.</p>
<p>9.	The law does not require you to sell your home to the landlord. It also does not obligate the landlord to sell the park or your lot to you.</p>
<p>10.	The law allows the landlord to place reasonable restrictions on who lives in your home and the qualifications of any purchaser of your home if it is to remain in the community. Read your rental agreement.</p>
<p>11.	Some manufactured home communities offer you more security in the form of long-term lease agreements which may provide more predictable rent increases. You have the right to negotiate for terms that meet your needs.</p>
<p>12.	Manufactured home park living can offer real value for your housing dollar, but remember that no form of private housing can guarantee you a place to live forever without regard to your ability to pay the costs of that housing. Before you buy a home or rent a space, find out: •	How often will your rent be increased and how are the increases determined?  •	How long can you afford to stay there?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>LEARN THE FACTS - MAKE THE HOUSING CHOICE THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU - </strong></p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>13.	TERMINATION OF TENANCY</strong></span></p>
<p>A.	By TENANT.  If this is a month-to-month tenancy, TENANT may terminate this tenancy upon a minimum of 30 days’ written notice to LANDLORD.  If such notice is given, TENANT agrees to remove TENANT’S RV from the Space by the termination date in the Notice.  Once TENANT’S 30-day notice is given, LANDLORD shall not be required to permit TENANT to remain at the Space beyond the 30-day period stated in the notice, even if LANDLORD has not yet found another tenant for the Space.  TENANT will be held responsible for any damage caused to the Community by removal of the RV and any other property of TENANT.</p>
<p>B.	By LANDLORD. LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(1)	TENANT or others occupying TENANT'S RV violate a law or ordinance which relates to TENANT’S conduct as a tenant or violates this Agreement or the Community Rules and Regulations.  In such case, if this is a month-to month tenancy, and TENANT has occupied the Premise for one year or less, LANDLORD may terminate TENANT’S tenancy without cause by giving not less than thirty (30) days’ advance written notice.  Provided, however, if TENANT has occupied the Premises for over one year, the no-cause advance written notice of termination may not be less than sixty (60) days.  LANDLORD may give a 30-day written notice of termination or such shorter period as allowed by law if the violation is a separate and distinct act or omission and is not ongoing.  If the violation is capable of being cured, TENANT may avoid termination by correcting the specified violation within 14 days or such other time provided in the notice from LANDLORD describing the violation.  If substantially the same violation reoccurs within 6 months, LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy by giving TENANT a non-curable 10-day written notice.  If this is a week-to-week tenancy, the 30-day period above is reduced to 7 days; the 14 day period above is reduced to 4 days, and the 10 day period above is reduced to 4 days.</p>
<p>(2)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy by giving 72 hours' written notice of nonpayment if TENANT fails to pay rent within 7 days after the first day rent becomes due, or 144 hours written notice of nonpayment if TENANT fails to pay rent within 4 days after the first day the rent becomes due.</p>
<p>(3)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy after 24 hours’ written notice specifying the cause if, among other reasons, (a) the TENANT, someone in the TENANT'S control or the TENANT'S pet seriously threatens to inflict substantial personal injury, or inflicts any substantial personal injury, upon a person on the premises other than the TENANT; (b) The TENANT or someone in the TENANT'S control recklessly endangers a person on the premises other than the TENANT by creating a serious risk of substantial personal injury; (c) The TENANT, someone in the TENANT'S control or the TENANT'S pet inflicts any substantial personal injury upon a neighbor living in the immediate vicinity of the premises; (d)  The TENANT or someone in the TENANT'S control intentionally inflicts any substantial damage to the premises or the TENANT'S pet inflicts substantial damage to the premises on more than one occasion; (e)(A) The TENANT intentionally provided substantial false information on the application for the tenancy within the past year; (B) The false information was with regard to a criminal conviction of the TENANT that would have been material to the LANDLORD'S acceptance of the application; and (C) The LANDLORD terminates the rental agreement within 30 days after discovering the falsity of the information; (f) The TENANT has vacated the premises, the person in possession is holding contrary to a written rental agreement that prohibits subleasing the premises to another or allowing another person to occupy the premises without the written permission of the LANDLORD, and the LANDLORD has not knowingly accepted rent from the person in possession; or (g)  The TENANT, someone in the TENANT'S control or the TENANT'S pet commits any act that is outrageous in the extreme, on the premises or in the immediate vicinity of the premises.</p>
<p>(4)	LANDLORD may terminate the tenancy prior to expiration of and fixed term if this is a lease as identified in Section 3 above, if the facility or a portion of it that includes the Space is to be closed.</p>
<p>(5)	LANDLORD has the absolute right to terminate this tenancy without cause unless this is a fixed term lease as identified in Section 3 above, in which case, absent a breach of the terms hereof, it will terminate automatically, with no further notice, at midnight of the last day of the lease term.  If this is a month-to-month tenancy, this Agreement may be terminated by not less than 30 days’ advance written notice.  If this is a week-to-week tenancy, it may be terminated by not less than 10 days’ advance written notice. (</p>
<p>6)	The preceding paragraphs (1)-(5) are not intended to limit LANDLORD’S right to terminate this tenancy for any other reasons as allowed by state, federal or local laws, now existing or hereinafter enacted.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">14.	SERVICE OF NOTICES</span></strong></p>
<p>Where written notice between LANDLORD and TENANT is required or permitted by this Agreement or Oregon Laws, it shall be by (a) personal delivery; (b) first class mail; or (c) both first class mail and attachment of a copy at a designated location.  In the case of notice to TENANT, the attachment shall be at the main entrance of TENANT’S RV.  In the case of notice to LANDLORD, the attachment shall be at the address of the manager identified in Paragraph 4, above.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>15.	INDEMNIFICATION BY TENANT</strong></span></p>
<p>Tenant shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend LANDLORD from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, liability and expense, including, but not limited to, attorney and other professional fees in connection with the loss of life, personal injury and/or damage to property arising from the occupancy or use by TENANT, or those persons occupying the Space or any part thereof, caused wholly or in part by any act or omission of the TENANT, TENANT’S family, TENANT’S pets, visitors, guests or invitees.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>16.	SEVERANCE CLAUSE</strong></span></p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement or any document incorporated into this Agreement is ruled invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected and each other term and provision shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Oregon Laws.  The parties agree that should a court rule that a provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, that ruling shall not be placed into evidence to any jury empanelled to hear any other dispute between LANDLORD and TENANT.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>17.	WAIVER</strong></span></p>
<p>LANDLORD’S failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement or the rules and regulations shall not be deemed a waiver of LANDLORD’S right to do so on future occasions.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>18.	ATTORNEY FEES, COSTS, DISBURSEMENTS</strong></span></p>
<p>In the event of suit, action or arbitration instituted to enforce or interpret any provision of this Agreement, the losing party shall pay the prevailing party's reasonable attorney fees upon trial or arbitration and/or appeal therefrom, together with all costs and disbursements.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>19.	INSPECTION</strong></span></p>
<p>By signing this Agreement, TENANT agrees that TENANT has carefully inspected the Community and Space, and has found them to be acceptable and in the condition as represented by LANDLORD.  To the extent permitted by Oregon law, TENANT accepts the condition of the Community and Space, in its present condition at the commencement of the tenancy, with all defects, apparent or not apparent.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>20.	CONDEMNATION</strong></span></p>
<p>LANDLORD shall be exclusively entitled to any payment or award for the taking of any portion of the Community under the power of eminent domain, except that TENANT will be entitled to any payment or award attributable solely to the loss or damage to TENANT’S RV or other personal property owned by TENANT.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>21.	MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENT AND RULES</strong></span></p>
<p>Modification of Agreement.  This Agreement represents the final understanding between the parties and may not be modified or amended, except in writing, signed by both LANDLORD and TENANT.  Notwithstanding the preceding, LANDLORD shall have the right, subject only to any applicable advance notice imposed by this Agreement or Oregon law, to unilaterally amend this Agreement or the Community Rules and Regulations.</p>

<p>C.	This RV must be: (a) Located in a manufactured dwelling park, mobile home park or recreational vehicle park as defined by Oregon law; (b) Occupied as a residential dwelling; and (c) Lawfully connected to water and electrical supply systems and a sewage disposal system.  If (a), (b) and (c) exist in this tenancy, a state agency or local government may not, solely on the grounds that this is a recreational vehicle occupancy, prohibit the placement or occupancy of the RV or impose any limit on the length of occupancy.  The preceding does not limit the authority of a state agency or local government to impose other special conditions on the placement or occupancy of the RV if the tenancy is for the occupancy of a recreational vehicle in a manufactured dwelling park, mobile home park or recreational vehicle park.</p>

"235","235","3","Overview of Abandonment Law","Overview of Abandonment Law (ORS 90.675)

By Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC - MHCO Legal Counsel

1. Generally

1.1 PCQ Observations:

1.1.1 The law recognizes that upon abandonment, there are six primary interests: (1) the tenant, (2) the landlord, (3) the owner (if different from the tenant); (4) the lienholder, if any, (5) the tax collector and (6) the tax assessor. (Note also, that the estate of a deceased tenant/owner residing alone is afforded much of the protections now provided to lienholders.)

1.1.2 What follows is a summary of the abandonment laws. However, this material should not be relied upon in lieu of a thorough review of the law itself and consultation with legal counsel.

2. When abandonment may be declared:

2.1 The tenancy has ended by termination or expiration of the Rental/Lease Agreement, or by surrender or abandonment, and the landlord reasonably believes that the tenant has no intention of asserting any further claim to the premises; or,

2.2 The tenant has been absent from the premises continuously for at least seven (7) days following a court ordered termination that has not been executed upon the by sheriff; or,

2.3 The landlord receives possession of the premises from the sheriff following execution after a Notice of Restitution has been served. See, ORS 105.161

2.4 If the manufactured or floating home is left on the premises, the storage and sale process described in ORS 90.425 (for homes outside of a facility) and 90.675 (for homes inside a facility) must be followed. Any costs incurred by the landlord for execution of the judgment of restitution or for removal, storage or sale of the tenants' property and not recovered pursuant to the public sale provisions of those statutes ""shall be added to the judgment.""

3. Where abandoned personal property and manufactured and floating homes may be stored:

3.1 Subject only to limited exceptions regarding abandoned automobiles or special agreement with the tenant, it must be ""at a place of safekeeping.""

3.2 Manufactured and floating homes must be left upon the rented space.

4. The 45-day advance written notice from landlord to tenant before selling or disposing of abandoned property must be personally served, or sent by first class mail, addressed and mailed to the tenant at the premises, with copies to any post office box and forwarding address actually known by the landlord.

5. If the abandoned property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, a copy of the notice must be sent, via personal delivery or first class mail to:

5.1 Any lienholders actually known to the landlord as well as any lienholders ""of record."" However, the notice must also be sent to any address provided to the landlord in a written notice identifying the home and space that was received from the lienholder within the preceding five (5) years;

5.2 Any owners, if different from the tenant;

5.3 Tax collector of the county where the RV, manufactured home or vehicle is
located; and
5.4 The assessor of the county where the property is located.

6. Contents of the written notice sent to the tenant, lienholder and owner must inform of the following:

6.1 That the personal property is considered abandoned;

6.2 That they must contact the landlord by a specified date to arrange for removal:

6.3 For RVs, manufactured and floating homes, this cannot be less than 45 days after personal delivery or first class mailing of the notice

6.4 The property will be stored in a place of safekeeping, which in the case of an RV, manufactured or floating home shall be the rented space;

6.5 Recipient(s) may arrange for removal by contacting the landlord at a described telephone number or address on or before the specified date;

6.6 Note that if the personal property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, the tenant may not remove it if :(i) the lienholder has foreclosed its lien; (ii) the tenant has waived their rights in writing in a good faith agreement with the landlord not more than 7 days prior to termination of the tenancy; or (iii) the applicable time for the tenant to respond has expired.

6.7 The landlord will make the personal property available for removal by the tenant or any lienholder or owner by appointment at reasonable times.

6.8 The landlord may require payment of storage charges prior to releasing the personal property. (Note: The storage charges shall not exceed the latest monthly space rent last payable by the tenant.)

6.9 If the property is considered abandoned as a result of the execution of a Judgment of Restitution, the landlord shall not require payment of storage charges prior to releasing the property.

6.10 If they fail to contact the landlord within the specified time, or after making contact with the landlord, fail to remove the home within: (a) 30 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes; or (b) 15 days for all other personal property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property. (Note: the 30-day period applies to RVs, and manufactured and floating homes located in or out of a facility.)

6.11 If the landlord reasonably believes the county assessor will determine that the ""current market value"" of the personal property is $8,000 or less, and the landlord intends to dispose of the property if it is not claimed, the notice shall state that belief and intent. (""Current market value"" is defined to mean"" ... the amount in cash, as determined by the county assessor that could reasonably be expected to be paid for (the home) by an informed buyer to an informed seller .... "")

6.12 If applicable, there is a lienholder that has a right to claim the property if otherwise qualified under ORS 90.675;

7. After sending the written notification, the landlord shall store the personal property as follows:

7.1 Manufactured or floating homes: On the rented space or slip, exercising reasonable care;

7.2 All other abandoned personal property, including goods left inside an RV, manufactured or floating home, upon the rented space outside of said home, in a place of safekeeping, exercising reasonable care.

7.2.1 Exceptions for rotting food and abandoned pets or livestock.

7.2.2 May be stored at the dwelling unit, commercial storage or other place of safekeeping.

8. Upon receipt of the written notice, the tenant, lienholder or owner may respond within the 45 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes or the 5 to 8 day period described above for all other personal property. The landlord must make the property available within the next 30 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes and 15 days for all other abandoned personal property.

8.1 If the tenant, lienholder or owner fail to respond, or are late in responding, the personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned and they shall have no further right to the property.

8.2 PCQ Note: This does not mean that they do not have any right to distribution of any sale proceeds. They still do!

8.3 After the property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned, the landlord may:

8.3.1 Destroy or otherwise dispose of the home if the landlord determines from the county assessor that the current market value is $8,000 or less.

8.3.2 Otherwise, the landlord must conduct a public or private sale as follows;

8.3.2.1 If the property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, the
landlord may seek to transfer the certificate of title and registration by complying with the requirements of the Building Codes Division of the Oregon Department of Business and Consumer Services, in the case of manufactured or floating homes, or the State Marine Board, in the case of floating homes.
8.3.2.2 Additionally, if the property is an RV, manufactured or floating
home (and market value is $8,000 or more), the landlord must do the following:
8.3.2.2.1 Advertise the sale in a newspaper of general circulation where the RV or home is located.
8.3.2.2.2 At a reasonable time prior to the sale, give a copy of the newspaper notice to the tenant and any lienholder or owner by personal delivery or first class mail (or in the case of a lienholder, with a certificate of mailing).
8.3.2.2.3 Obtain an Affidavit of Publication from the newspaper showing that the notice ran at least one day for each of two consecutive weeks prior to the date of the sale or the last date bids will be accepted.
8.3.2.2.4 Obtain written proof from the county that all property taxes on the manufactured or floating home have been paid, or if not paid, that the County
has authorized the sale.
9. Conduct of the sale.
9.1 For RVs, manufactured or floating homes, the method, manner, time, place and terms of the sale must be commercially reasonable and conform to the information contained in the landlord's published notice.
9.2 For all other property the sale must be in accordance with ORS 79.5040 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”).
10. Treatment of the proceeds of sale:
10.1 If there is no buyer at the sale, the property is automatically considered to be worth $8,000 or less, regardless of current market value, and the landlord may destroy or otherwise dispose of the personal property.
10.2 The landlord may deduct:
10.2.1 The reasonable or actual cost of notice, storage and sale, and
10.2.2 Unpaid rent.
10.2.3 The remaining proceeds are to be distributed according to the following priorities:
10.2.3.1 County tax collector (manufactured or floating homes only);
10.2.3.2 Any lienholder to the extent of any unpaid balance owned;
10.2.3.3 The balance to the tenant or owner, with an itemized accounting.
10.2.4 If the tenant or owner cannot, after due diligence, be found, the proceeds are to be deposited with the treasurer of the County where the sale occurred, and if not claimed within 3 years they revert to the county.
11. The county tax collector shall cancel all unpaid property taxes if:
11.1 The landlord disposes of the property after the county assessor has determined that the current market value is $8,000 or less;
11.2 There is no buyer at the sale;
11.3 The current market value is $8,000 or less, there is a buyer at the sale, but the proceeds of sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes owed on the home after distribution of the proceeds pursuant to statute (i.e. first to the landlord for actual costs of sale and storage charges, then to the tax assessor and next to the lienholder and last, to the tenant.).
11.4 The landlord buys the property at the sale, the current market value is more than $8,000, the proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the property taxes, and the landlord disposes of the home.

11.5 PCQ Comment: Realistically, landlords who intend to bid at the auction of a home with a tax assessor determined fair market value in excess of $8,000, should plan on paying the unpaid property taxes if they acquire the home at the sale, since those taxes will not be cancelled.

12. If the landlord fails to comply with the abandonment statute, the tenant is relieved of liability for any non-deliberate or non-negligent damage to the premises and for unpaid space rent and the landlord may be held liable for twice the tenant's actual damages.

12.1 Lienholders may recover actual damages from the landlord (but not attorney fees).

12.2 The county tax assessor may recover actual damages (but not attorney fees) in cases of landlord fraud.

13. Special rights of lienholders in manufactured and floating homes:

13.1 Within the 45-day period, the lienholder may request that the landlord enter into written agreement that the dwelling or home not be sold or disposed of for up to 12 months, so long as the lienholder makes timely periodic payment of all storage charges and maintains the dwelling or home and the rented space on which it is stored.

13.2 Lienholders have 60 days to sign and return the storage agreement. The law permits - with specific limitations - the right to include certain utility charges, late charges, and increased the storage charges. The landlord's right to storage fees accrues from the commencement of the 45-day period. Also, if the landlord wants any physical defects repaired, they must be reasonably described in the storage agreement. There are other limitations if the home was placed on the space within the previous 24 months. The repairs must be completed within 90 days and if not, the agreement may be terminated with 14 days' written notice.)

13.3 During the storage agreement period, the lienholder has the right to remove the property, but now must give not less than 14 days advance written notice. All storage charges must be paid before such removal.

13.5 The lienholder may sell the manufactured dwelling or floating home on site, subject to any terms previously agreed upon between the landlord and tenant, or if no agreement, any reasonable conditions imposed by the landlord. In the case of manufactured or floating homes located within facilities, ORS 90.680 applies, which permits landlords to apply their existing tenant screening criteria.

13.6 If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate it upon 90 days' written notice, during which time the lienholder may cure the default. If the default pertains to the nonpayment of a storage charge and the lienholder cures, but defaults a second time, the cure period is reduced to 30 days. If the lienholder fails to timely cure, the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling without further notice to the lien holder.

13.7 Upon termination of the storage agreement, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, or the lienholder has sold or removed the home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice. (Note: This does not mean that the landlord must go through the entire notice procedure again; the sale procedures must be followed if the market value is above $8,000.)

14. If the personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession such as an heir or devisee, timely requests within the 45-day period, they may enter into a written agreement with the landlord that the home not be sold or disposed of for up to 90 days or the conclusion of probate, whichever is longer, so long as storage charges are paid and the space is maintained. If the landlord knows the identity of any personal representative or designated person, a copy of the 45-day letter should be sent to them. (The original 45-day letter should be addressed in the name of the personal representative or designated person and mailed to the premises in the community. Don’t address the notice in the name of the deceased tenant!)

15. A landlord shall not, as a condition of approving an on-site sale, require a tenant or lienholder to waive any rights created under the abandonment law.

16. Homes posing extreme health or safety hazards. (The specifics of the statute should be closely reviewed.)

16.1 If a governmental agency declares a home an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law there is an expedited mailing and removal process.

16.2 The 45-day letter has been reduced to 15 days.

16.3 The response/removal time is 7 days.

16.4 There is no lienholder right to enter into a storage agreement.

","Overview of Abandonment Law (ORS 90.675)

By Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC - MHCO Legal Counsel

1. Generally

1.1 PCQ Observations:

1.1.1 The law recognizes that upon abandonment, there are six primary interests: (1) the tenant, (2) the landlord, (3) the owner (if different from the tenant); (4) the lienholder, if any, (5) the tax collector and (6) the tax assessor. (Note also, that the estate of a deceased tenant/owner residing alone is afforded much of the protections now provided to lienholders.)

<p>A ""REPEAT VIOLATION"" is one in which substantially the same act or omission that previously constituted a violation for which a Notice to Vacate was given to the tenant occurs again within six (6) months from the date of issuance of that Notice. In the case of a REPEAT VIOLATION, the landlord may terminate this tenancy upon not less than ten (10) days' prior written notice (for a monthly tenancy or violation of a lease) or not less than four (4) days (for a week-to-week tenancy) specifying the violation and the DATE OF TERMINATION. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO CURE A REPEAT VIOLATION. However, a landlord may not terminate a rental or lease agreement under the REPEAT VIOLATION provisions of Oregon law, if the only violation is a failure to pay the current month's rent.</p>

<p><strong>1.   LOCATION AND SIZE OF SPACE</strong></p>
<p>The location and approximate size of your space #______ &nbsp;is as follows: ________________Please see attached map.  We do not reserve spaces.  It is first come, first served.</p>
<p><strong>2.   FACILITY CLASSIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>This is a  (check one) [ &nbsp;] 55 and older [ &nbsp;] family &nbsp;[ &nbsp;] 62 and older, facility. If this is an age 55 and older facility at least one occupant of the home must be 55 years of age or older, and you may not sell your home to someone under age 55. If this is an age 62 and older facility all occupants of the home must be 62 years of age or older, and you may not sell your home to someone under age 62.  There are no such limitations if this facility is open to families.  However, we cannot promise to keep the present classification forever.  It could change.  Pursuant to Oregon law, occupancy is limited to two persons per bedroom.  In the event that Federal law is interpreted as less restrictive, the Federal law will apply.</p>
<p><strong>3.   CURRENT ZONING</strong></p>
<p>The current zoning affecting the use of the rented space is (check with governmental authority to verify): ________________________________.  Permitted uses include mobile/manufactured housing.  The zoning authority for this Community is ____________________. We are not aware of any pending governmental action which could impact the Community's zoning at this time.  Exceptions to the preceding sentence (if any): __________________________________________________________.</p>
<p><strong>4.   RENT ADJUSTMENT POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Under current state law the landlord may increase your rent with 90 days notice.  State law does not limit the amount or the frequency of rent increases,   Our policy is the same.  We reserve the right to charge you certain other fees, deposits and charges (such as utility charges, which maybe passed through directly to you) which are not regarded as ""rent"" and may be increased <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>without</strong></span> a prior 90-day notice.</p>

<p>Many financial consultants and mortgage lenders advise consumers to keep the total of rent, utility and mobile/manufactured housing mortgage payments below 30% of take-home pay or income. This can be important if your income is fixed.   <strong>Please understand that we want you as a tenant if you can afford it.  We don’t want to create financial problems for you or us, so we share these facts with you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.   PERSONAL PROPERTY, SERVICES AND FACILITIES PROVIDED BY LANDLORD</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the services necessary to maintain the facility in a habitable condition, the landlord will not be providing any additional personal property, services or facilities for the use of residents, except as indicated below. We provide the following (check all applicable box(es)): [ &nbsp;] mailboxes, [ &nbsp;] garbage containers, [ &nbsp;]water line, [ &nbsp;] faucet for outdoor use, [ &nbsp;] outside space lighting, [ &nbsp;]laundromat, [ &nbsp;] visitor parking, [ &nbsp;] recreation room, [ &nbsp;] pool, [ &nbsp;] RV parking, &nbsp;[ &nbsp;] other ____________________ ________________________________________________________________________.</p>
<p>Some things you should know we do not provide are: (delete inapplicable items): yard maintenance of tenant spaces, locked gates, security guards, restricted access to the Community, emergency first aid, and emergency utilities or R.V. parking.  We must ask you to be responsible for the security of your own home and possessions and report any security problems to police and management.</p>
<p>Our policy on landscape maintenance is as follows:  You maintain your space, including the lawn and all trees and shrubs and we maintain the common areas.  Any exterior improvements or construction you intend to make to your space, including but not limited to fencing, landscaping or sheds, or to the exterior of the home (such as skirting, porches, painting, garage, carport, etc.), must first receive written approval of management, and must conform to all local, State and Federal laws, ordinances and regulations.  Mobile/manufactured home set-up must meet all applicable codes and be completed within the number of days designated in your rental agreement.</p>
<p>Upon termination of your tenancy, the space must be left in substantially the same condition as it was upon commencement.  You will be solely responsible for all damage to the space as a result of initial siting of the home and its removal from the space.  All plantings or other landscaping placed upon the space, whether by the landlord or tenant, shall become the property of the landlord upon termination of the tenancy, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing prior to such termination.</p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Changes to Utilities and Services:</strong></span> Please note that even if Landlord has agreed to pay for any utilities noted above, the rental agreement may allow for landlord to change this and pass all utilities through directly to you.   We reserve the right to change utility payment arrangements, including the billing procedure, with reasonable notice to you.  Unless your rental agreement provides otherwise, we reserve the right to bill you separately for utility service fees and charges assessed by the utility for services provided to or for spaces in the Community.  Any separately billed utility fees and charges shall not be considered to be included in the rent charged for those spaces under the rental agreement and shall not be considered to be rent or a rent increase.  Utility services to which this applies are natural or liquid propane gas, electricity, water, cable television, garbage or refuse service, and sewer service.  However, nothing contained herein shall be construed to require our rental agreement to provide for separate billing to tenants of fees and charges.</p>
<p>Nonessential utilities, such as cable TV, could be discontinued if no provider were available or bulk rates (where applicable) were not available.</p>

<p><strong>8.   RENTAL AGREEMENT TERMINATION POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Under current state law, your tenancy may terminate for cause as specified by law, which includes, among other causes, the failure to pay rent, violation of Community rules or your rental agreement.  It may also terminate upon closure of the Community or upon expiration of your rental agreement term.  Our policy is the same.</p>
<p><strong>9.   COMMUNITY CLOSURE POLICY</strong></p>
<p>1.1.	Under current state law, if a manufactured dwelling park, or a portion of the park that includes the space for a manufactured dwelling, is to be closed and the land or &nbsp;easehold converted to a use other than as a manufactured dwelling park (and the closure is not required by the exercise of eminent domain or by order of federal, state or local agencies) the landlord may terminate a month-to-month or fixed term rental agreement for a manufactured dwelling park space by giving tenants not less than 365 days' notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination and by paying tenants one of the following amounts for their dwelling: (a) $5,000 if it is a single-wide; (b) $7,000 if it is a double-wide; or (c) $9,000 if it is a triple-wide or larger.  Certain local jurisdictions in Oregon may have ordinances that provide increased benefits and/or money to tenants located in a manufactured dwelling park that is closing.  Our policy is the same. You are encouraged to review ORS Chapter 90 (Oregon’s landlord-tenant law) and your local city or county ordinances regarding park closure, or have an expert do so on your behalf before entering into your tenancy. We have no current plans to close all or any portion of the Community, but this could change in the future.</p>
<p><strong>10.  POLICY REGARDING SALE OF THE COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Pursuant to Oregon law, if requested by a tenant association or facility purchase association (""the association"") to do so, the owner is obliged to notify them of the listing for sale of the Community or of written offers of purchase which the landlord intends to consider.  Thereafter, the landlord may be required to negotiate in good faith with the association for sale of the Community to them.  This does not apply to tax deferred exchanges of the Community.   Our policy is the same.  We have no present intention to sell the Community, but you must understand that this could change in the future.</p>
<p><strong>11.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> To encourage Community residents and the owner/manager to settle disputes, it is the policy of this Community that each issue with merit shall be given a fair hearing within 30 days of receipt of a written complaint.  The specific procedure for dispute resolution is set forth in your rental agreement and/or Rules and Regulations.  However, we do not offer arbitration or mediation of those disputes relating to:  (a)  Nonpayment of rent or other fees and charges provided in the rental agreement;  (b)  Increases in rent; (c)  Closure or sale of the Community; or (d)  Disputes for which the owner/manager could terminate the tenancy with 24-hour notice under ORS 90.400, or (d) Any dispute which resulted in a non-curable notice such as a repeat rules violation or a ""three strikes"" violation.</p>

If the landlord fails to provide the new documents to tenant prior to 60 days before the ending date, the tenancy shall automatically become a month-to-month tenancy upon the same terms and conditions as contained in the lease, subject to landlord’s right to increase the rent pursuant to Oregon law.  Our policy is the same.</p>

Landlord also reserves the right to impose as a condition of sale that tenant comply with certain other requirements, such as payment of all past due rent, payment of all past due taxes or assessments.  If certain repairs are not made to the home following written notice from the landlord to do so, the home may have to be removed from the Community.  Removal may affect market value of the home.</p>

READERS ARE  ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THEIR OWN ATTORNEY OR OTHER EXPERT IN THIS SPECIALIZED AREA.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>1. What is SAFE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SAFE is the acronym for The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008.   Although it is federal legislation that was enacted in response to the national credit and  mortgage crises, it requires each state to enact regulatory legislation. HUD monitors  compliance, although it does not have legal authority to grant exemptions.  On August 30,  2011, HUD published its Final Rule for SAFE.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HUD is responsible for setting minimum standards for states to following in the licensing of  providers of certain residential mortgage services.  It also has set up the Nationwide Mortgage  Licensing System and Registry (“NMLSR”), which is a national database of all mortgage  companies and mortgage loan originators. Responsibility for oversight falls under the  authority of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank  Act.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>2. What is the purpose of the SAFE Act?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SAFE was designed to increase consumer protection in residential lending.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>3. What activities does SAFE apply to?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It applies to mortgage companies and their mortgage loan originators or “MLOs” acting either  as employees or independent contractors.   An individual is in the business of loan origination  if they, “in a commercial context and habitually or repeatedly” engage in: (1) taking a  residential mortgage loan application; and (2) offering or negotiating the terms of a  residential mortgage loan for compensation or gain; or represent to the public (e.g. through  advertising or other means of communicating) that they will perform these two activities.    The phrase “taking a residential mortgage loan application” means that the MLO receives it  for the purpose of facilitating a credit decision.  The phrase “offering or negotiating” means  that the MLO presents particular lending terms for consideration by a borrower.  It is the  activity - not its label or the title of the person - that determines whether one is a mortgage  loan originator.  The law does not make one a mortgage loan originator if they engage in the  above-described conduct exclusively for public, charitable, or family purposes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In order to obtain a license as an MLO, SAFE requires testing, pre-licensure and continuing  education, criminal background checks and financial responsibility.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>4. What type of transactions does SAFE apply to?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SAFE applies to certain mortgage transactions. A “mortgage transaction” means a credit or  loan transaction that is or will be used by the debtor primarily for personal, family, or  household purposes <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>and</strong></span> is secured by a mortgage or equivalent consensual security interest  on a dwelling or residential real estate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5. Does SAFE apply to the financing of manufactured homes and manufactured  vehicles?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes.  The term ""dwelling"" is cross-referenced to the definition of “dwelling” in section 103(v)  of the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) (15 U.S.C. 1601 note).  Regulation Z, which implements  TILA, defines “dwelling” to mean ""a residential structure that contains 1 to 4 units, whether or  not that structure is attached to real property. Besides attached homes, a dwelling also  includes an individual condominium unit, cooperative unit, mobile home, and trailer, if it is  used as a residence.""  HUD interprets a ""mobile home"" to include a manufactured home, as  defined in the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As to loans secured by manufactured homes treated as personal property under state law  HUD’s final rule states:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>…an individual engaging in the business of a loan originator with respect to a loan  that is to be secured by a manufactured home, mobile home, recreational vehicle, <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>house boat, or trailer that is to be used as a residence is subject to licensing under the  SAFE Act.  Even if a state categorizes loans secured by such residential structures <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>as  chattel mortgages, the SAFE Act covers these loans and such states must ensure that  individuals engaging in the business of a loan originator with respect to these <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>loans  are licensed under the SAFE Act.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6. Does SAFE apply to sellers of manufactured homes if they don’t directly “lend”  purchase money funds, but merely carry back <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>paper, such as a retail installment contract or  note and security interest in the home?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes.  This was specifically addressed in HUD’s Final Rule:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>A ‘‘residential mortgage loan’’ includes an installment sales contract, which the  commenters advise is frequently involved in seller financing. ‘‘Residential mortgage <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>loans,’’ as defined by section 1503(8) of the SAFE Act, refer to typical financing  mechanisms such as mortgages and deeds of trusts.  In addition, the SAFE Act  definition <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>also includes ‘‘other equivalent consensual security interest on a dwelling  (as the term ‘dwelling’ is defined by section 103(v) of TILA) or residential real estate  upon which <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>is constructed or intended to be constructed a dwelling,’’ which has the  potential for including a broad range of other financing mechanisms.  For the  purposes of this rule, <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>‘‘equivalent consensual security interests’’ specifically include  installment sales contracts, consistent with the treatment by many states of such  contracts in the same <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>manner as mortgages and purchase money mortgages offered  by sellers of residential real estate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>7. Who regulates Oregon’s statewide version of SAFE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Oregon’s version of SAFE is found at ORS Chapter 86A.    It is known as the “Oregon Mortgage  Lender Law.”  The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (“DCBS”)  has general supervision and control over all loan originators, mortgage bankers and mortgage  brokers residing in Oregon or doing business in Oregon - even though they do not reside here.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>8. Under Oregon law, who qualifies as a mortgage loan originator, mortgage banker  and mortgage broker?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <strong>loan originator</strong> is defined under Oregon law to mean an individual employed by or acting as  an agent or independent contractor for a mortgage banker or mortgage broker with the  expectation of compensation or gain that is determined by the amount borrowed or the  terms and conditions agreed to by the mortgage loan borrower.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <strong>loan originator</strong> is the individual having the primary job responsibilities, including  negotiating with a potential borrower for the purpose of establishing the terms and  conditions of a mortgage loan.  A loan originator does not include an individual whose  responsibilities are clerical or administrative, such as gathering information, requesting  information, word processing, soliciting general interest in mortgage loans, sending  correspondence and assembling files.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Subject to several exceptions, a <strong>mortgage banker</strong> is one who for compensation or in the  expectation of compensation, directly or indirectly makes, negotiates or offers to make or  negotiate, a mortgage banking loan or a mortgage loan, and services or sells a mortgage  banking loan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The term does not include financial institutions, financial holding companies, bank holding  companies, savings and loan holding companies as defined under state and federal laws. It  also excludes various individuals who make loans secured by an interest in real estate for the  person’s own investment and who is not engaged in the business of making such loans;  Oregon licensed attorneys; real property owners who sell their own property; builders and  contractors who accept repayment on an installment or deferred payment basis and arising  out of labor and materials furnished in the improvement of that real property, and those who  are exercising their statutory lien rights.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <strong>mortgage broker</strong> is one who engages all or part of the time, for the account of others, or for  the person’s own account, in the business of: (1) Selling real estate paper whether as an  issuer, agent or principal; (2) Accepting funds from one or more persons or (3) For  compensation, or the expectation of compensation, directly or indirectly makes, negotiates or  offers to make or negotiate a mortgage loan.     The exemptions found for mortgage bankers, described above, generally exist for mortgage  brokers, and include real estate licensees, if such services are incidental to their professional  real estate activity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>9. If I have a manufactured dealer’s license would I still be subject to SAFE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It appears so. Here is what HUD’s Final Rule and Oregon’s statute provide:    A person with a manufactured structure dealer’s license who provides services  customarily associated with the retail sales of manufactured dwellings (including  communication of generally available information regarding mortgage loans) is  excluded from being a mortgage broker, unless:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(1) The person receives from a purchaser a fee or commission as a mortgage  broker or mortgage banker that is disclosed in the sales contract, purchase agreement  or <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>applicable federal documents;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(2) For the benefit of a potential purchaser, the person completes a loan  application form or other document that is part of a mortgage banking loan and  completes a good <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>faith estimate under the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures  Act (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(3) The person solicits or receives credit information from a prospective  purchaser for the purpose of making credit decisions (Underscore added.); or</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(4) The person negotiates with a potential purchaser the terms of a mortgage  loan including but not limited to points, interest rates, length of loan or other loan  conditions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is this underscored language above that appears to bring you under SAFE, and by  extension, the Oregon law.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>10. Do Mortgage Bankers and Mortgage Brokers have to be licensed in Oregon?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes.  ORS 86A.103  provides that “…it is unlawful for any person to engage in residential  mortgage transactions in this state as a mortgage banker or mortgage broker unless the  person is licensed….”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>11. How does one apply for a Mortgage Banker or Mortgage Broker license?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The law can be found at ORS 86A.106 and rules prescribed by the Director of the Department  of Consumer and Business Services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>12. What does Oregon law provide regarding Mortgage Loan Originators?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following is a brief summary:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• The names of all mortgage loan originators (“MLOs”) employed by mortgage bankers  or brokers must be provided to the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services  (“DCBS”) and kept at least 30 days’ current.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Mortgage bankers and brokers are required to provide the DCBS with satisfactory  evidence (as determined by administrative rule) that each of the people they have hired or  intend to hire have: (1) Successfully completed an entry-level training course approved or  provided by an organization certified by the DCBS director; and (2) Passed an examination.  If  the individual has been employed as a loan originator for two or more years in this state, they  must have completed the required continuing education.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Mortgage loan originators (as well as mortgage bankers and brokers) may not engage  in dishonest, fraudulent or illegal practices or conduct in a business or profession or engage in  unfair or unethical practices or conduct in connection with the mortgage business; Willfully or  repeatedly violate or fail to comply with a provision of the regulatory laws; Fail to account for  money or property received in connection with a mortgage loan; Fail to meet the training,  education or continuing education requirements for mortgage loan originators; Perform an  act as a mortgage loan originator in a negligent or incompetent manner.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>13. What is the cost of licensing/registering with the DCBS?</strong> Here are the latest administrative rules:     Mortgage Bankers or Brokers   In addition to any fees required to participate in the National Mortgage Licensing  System and Registry, a mortgage banker or a mortgage broker shall pay to the  director the following fees at the time of application or renewal:   (1) A nonrefundable application fee for a mortgage banker or mortgage broker  license of $960 plus a $330 nonrefundable application fee for each branch the  mortgage banker or mortgage broker establishes in Oregon.   (2) A nonrefundable renewal application fee for a mortgage banker or mortgage  broker license of $480 plus a $165 nonrefundable renewal application fee for each  branch the mortgage banker or mortgage broker maintains in Oregon.     Mortgage Loan Originators   (1) In addition to any fees required to participate in the National Mortgage  Licensing System and Registry, a person applying for a mortgage loan originator  license shall pay to the director a nonrefundable fee of $80 for the issuance of a  mortgage loan originator license.   (2) In addition to any fees required to participate in the National Mortgage  Licensing System and Registry, a person renewing a mortgage loan originator license  shall pay to the director a nonrefundable fee of $65 for the renewal of a mortgage  loan originator license.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>14. What are the penalties if I fail to comply?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to ORS 86A.130, whenever the Director of the DCBS has “reasonable cause to believe”  that a person has been engaged or is engaging in any violation of Oregon law (including acting as a  mortgage broker, banker or loan originator without a license), the director may bring suit against  the alleged perpetrator.  The court may fine the person not more than $5,000 for each violation.    Each violation is a separate offense. In the case of a continuing violation, each day’s continuance is  a separate violation, but the maximum penalty for any continuing violation is $20,000 for each  offense.  The court may also appoint a receiver (who can be the Director of the DCBS over the  defendant’s assets).  Additionally, the statute allows for attorney fees.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The director may include a claim for restitution or damages on behalf “of the persons  injured” by the unlawful act or practice.  Additionally, the director may bring a claim for  “disgorgement of illegal gains or profits derived.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>15. What are my choices if I am an Oregon park owner and want to rehab and sell  abandoned or pre-abandoned manufactured homes to prospective buyers who will occupy them?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It appears that you have two choices:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(1) Hire as an employee or independent contractor a MLO who will engage in the activities  described for them under state law.  This will require you to become either a mortgage banker  or mortgage broker.  The reason for this is because the MLO is required to work under the  supervision and control of one or the other.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(2) Contract with an existing MLO who is already working for an Oregon licensed mortgage banker  or broker.  Presumably, this would be on an independent contractor basis.       NOTE:  THE ABOVE INFORMATION WILL BE UPDATED AND CLARIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME.

"203","203","1","Phil Querin Q&A Selling Homes and Working With a Third Party Mortgage Banker & the SAFE ACT","<p><strong>Question*: I</strong>f a community owner sells one or more homes (e.g. those received via abandonment or pre-abandonment) with the help of a Mortgage Loan Originator (“MLO”) working for a third party mortgage banker or mortgage broker, after the buyer’s installment contract is completed and signed, can the community owner then collect the payments himself?  In other words, now that MLO has complied with the SAFE Act, can this receivable be returned to the community owner to collect the monthly payments?  My concern is that someone might say that since the owner is now receiving the payments, he is engaged in the business of “loan servicing” - even though it’s his own home; he’s not in the lending or servicing business; and not receiving or expecting compensation for the act of servicing).  It could pose a real financial hardship on community owners if they had to pay a third party for servicing that they can do themselves.  The primary reason park owners do this is to fill vacant homes, not to make big money on the sale itself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong> Answer:</strong> Per the Oregon Department of Community and Business Services, “…there is definitely no license for that.”  [Note: This answer may not apply if the community owner is collecting the payments for an unrelated third party who holds the installment contract.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>Comment: The above question supplements the FAQs posted by MHCO  regarding the SAFE Act earlier this month.  According to the Oregon  Department of Community and Business Services (“DCBS”), the Act applies  to manufactured community owners who sell homes acquired following  abandonment or pre-abandonment.

"205","205","3","Resident Pays After FED Issued Settles Before Hearing","<p>Question:  We have had to file two consecutive FED Complaints against a resident.  The day before the first appearance for each case, the resident tender the rent that was due, although he do not pay the court fees of $115.00.  After two months of this, he owes us $230.00.  He promises to repay this amount but does not.  Now rent is due for January, 2012.  We are sure the same thing will happen again. How can we collect the court fees?</p>
<p>Answer:  I assume that when he tenders the rent, you accept it and report to the court that the case is to be dismissed.  This means that any leverage you had to make the full payment, including court fees, has disappeared.  You might consider one of the two following alternatives:</p>
<p>1.	Since the 72 hours has already expired and you’ve had to file the FED complaint, you are not required to accept the rent unless he agrees to pay the court fees.  Next time, if he declines, don’t let the case be dismissed.  Go to the regularly scheduled first appearance.  If he shows up, tell the judge you’d gladly permit him to stay if he pays the filing fees.  If he can’t afford to pay it in one lump sum, negotiate a repayment plan (e.g. 50% next month and 50% the following month).  Then have the judge put the agreement in a Stipulated Judgment of Restitution, which means that if he doesn’t pay the sums do as scheduled, you can go back to court to have him evicted.</p>
<p>2.	Under Oregon’s “three strikes” law [ORS 90.630(8)-(10)], if a resident is issued three 72-hour notices within a rolling 12 month period, you can issue them a 30-day non-curable eviction notice, on or shortly after, the third strike.  Then you can say to the resident that you will permit them to stay only on condition of payment of the outstanding court fees.  Obviously, this is a pretty big hammer and if they can’t pay the fees all at once, you should negotiate partial payments, similar to what I suggested above.  However, this alternative would automatically not result in a “Stipulated Judgment of Restitution” (you would have to be in court to get that).  For that reason, I prefer No. 1 over No. 2.</p>","<p>Question:  We have had to file two consecutive FED Complaints against a resident.

"207","207","3","Abandonment and Resident Destruction of Home","<p><strong>Question: </strong> A resident living alone passed away.  It took some time for the estate to get underway because they had to search for heirs.  An heir was located and was appointed as Administrator to act on behalf of the estate.    Shortly after the resident’s passing, we began requesting that a Storage Agreement be signed but the estate was hesitant to do so until the Administrator was appointed.  After the appointment the Administrator was initially cooperative, but unexpectedly changed his mind and is now threatening to bring all of the past due rent current, and then, out of spite, tear the home down while still on the space.  Presumably, after doing so, we would expect the Administrator to cease all further space rental payments.  How should we handle this?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> This sounds like an episode from a Jerry Springer reality show!  Your question doesn’t make it clear whether the estate was formally filed for probate in court, in which case this “Administrator” would be subject to court supervision and would have to have a bond.  I’m suspecting that is not the case – but if it is, you may want to secure legal counsel to notify the court of what’s happening and perhaps get him removed.</p>
<p>Assuming that the person is just a designee for the un-probated estate (I will call him the “representative”), I would suggest that you look to ORS 90.675(20), which applies when a resident living alone passes away.  Subsection (20) is summarized below, but should not be used as a substitute for reading ORS 90.675 (linked here) in its entirety:</p>
<p>•	This subsection (20) applies the same duties as those of a resident who abandoned the property.</p>
<p>•	It also applies to any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court, or any person designated in writing by the decedent to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant’s death;</p>
<p>•	The 45-day abandonment notice required in ORS 90.675(3) (go to above link) is to be sent by first class mail to this representative at the premises, and also personally delivered or sent by first class mail to them if actually known to the landlord.</p>
<p>•	If the representative responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided in the letter and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later.</p>
<p>•	<strong>Note:</strong> <em>Entering into the storage agreement includes the duty to pay a “storage fee” which can be no higher than the space rent. This duty is not triggered until the 45-day letter is sent.  Presumably you will use a good storage agreement that requires, among other things, compliance with all applicable park rules and state, federal and local laws and ordinances, including a duty to maintain the space.  On- site destruction of the home is NOT maintaining the space.  Depending upon the home’s age, on site destruction could be a violation of certain environmental laws, due to potentially hazardous material used in construction.  In fact, since there is a risk that the representative will not comply with the storage agreement – based on his threat of destruction - you may want to consider – only upon the advice of your attorney – to restrict his unsupervised access to the home.  Destruction of the home would not only take it off the tax rolls in violation of Oregon property tax law, but it would prevent you, as the landlord, from selling the home upon failure of the representative to meet his obligations.  Remember, in addition to the tax collector, you have a vested interest in seeing the home sold for recoupment any sums due (arguably including attorney fees) incurred during the abandonment process.</em></p>
<p>•	Since the abandonment law requires that the landlord has a duty of safe keeping pending completion of the abandonment process, it is my belief  that this entitles the landlord to secure the home (e.g. with a new lock) so that heirs and others cannot enter and remove personal property.</p>
<p>•	A storage agreement entitles the representative to store the personal property on the space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.</p>
<p>•	If such an agreement is entered into, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder (if any) until the agreement with the representative ends.</p>
<p>•	If the representative requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement and there is a lienholder, also, you should review subsections (19)(c) to (e) and (g)(C) of ORS 90.675, which describes the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.</p>
<p>•	During the term of the Storage Agreement, the representative has the right to remove or sell the property, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir who wishes to leave the property on the space and become a tenant.  However, this prospective tenant is subject to the same statutory requirement, including landlord qualification and approval, as found in ORS 90.680 (linked here). The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</p>
<p>•	If the representative violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate it by giving at least 30 days’ written notice to them stating facts sufficient to notify them of the reason for the termination. Unless the representative or person corrects the violation within the notice period, the Storage Agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the representative.</p>
<p>•	Upon the failure of a representative to enter into a storage agreement or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative has sold or removed the home, the landlord may sell or dispose of it pursuant to sale provisions of ORS 90.675 without further notice to the representative.</p>
<p>So, in summary, the abandonment statute – which is quite lengthy and somewhat difficult to follow – applies in this case, and with proper guidance, you should be able to successfully deal with the representative.</p>","<p><strong>Question: </strong> A resident living alone passed away.

"212","212","3","Rent to Own and SAFE Act Implications","<p>Question:  We just acquired a manufactured home in our community.  I would rather sell it to a new tenant, but would consider renting it out or doing a rent-to-own. If I pursue rent-to-own option,  will I be subject to the new SAFE Act?</p>
<p>Answer:  Remember that the SAFE Act only applies if the seller/landlord is providing financing, and in doing so, is going to make a credit decision regarding the buyer’s financial capacity.</p>
<p>In short, so long as you don’t extend credit (which includes carrying back a security agreement or other form of installment payment contract) you’re not subject to the Act.  If you do a credit check for your prospective tenant, this would not be covered by SAFE.  Make sure that your lease/option or rent-to-own paperwork is reviewed by legal counsel – and under no circumstances do you want to offer an extension of credit in the transactional documents.  Under SAFE, if you extend credit for the purchase of the home you would have to be a Mortgage Loan Originator as described in the Act.  I did an extensive summary (FAQs) on the SAFE Act, and you can link directly to it on the MHCO website.</p>
<p>However, on another note, you might want to consider what you are getting into as a landlord of mobile homes.  First, you will be responsible for providing certain statutory “essential services” which are far more extensive than if you were merely a landlord of the space.  Additionally, Oregon law imposes certain habitability duties on landlords who rent out homes.  See, ORS 90.320 and 90.360 and 90.365.</p>
<p>So before making a final decision, I suggest you look at the cost and benefit.  Even if you have to hire a Mortgage Loan Originator to assist in making the credit decision under the Safe Act, you can be sure that as an “owner” of the home, you will not be saddled with any of the long term duties of a residential landlord, which could prove costly.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you decide to sell the home – either for cash (which will not subject you to SAFE, since no credit decision is being made on the prospective resident as a “buyer”) or by carrying the financing yourself (which would subject you to SAFE), you must be very careful in the Bill of Sale and other sale documents, to make it very clear that this is an “AS-IS sale” and that you will not be subject to any warranties express or implied.  This is very important, since you’re failure to do so could impose upon you certain statutory warranties found in Oregon law.</p>","<p>Question:  We just acquired a manufactured home in our community.  I would rather sell it to a new tenant, but would consider renting it out or doing a rent-to-own. If I pursue rent-to-own option,  will I be subject to the new SAFE Act?</p>
<p>Answer:  Remember that the SAFE Act only applies if the seller/landlord is providing financing, and in doing so, is going to make a credit decision regarding the buyer’s financial capacity.</p>",,"1327355523","2"

If a dispute arises under this Agreement or the Park Rules and Regulations, TENANT may request a meeting with the park manager to discuss the dispute.  TENANT’S request must be in writing and must explain the dispute.  The park manager will meet with TENANT within 10 business days of receipt of a written complaint that has merit.  If the informal meeting does not resolve the matter, either party may request mediation.

B.	MEDIATION.   Either TENANT or LANDLORD may request mediation of a dispute by notifying the other party in writing.  Within 15 days of receipt of such a request, both parties shall attempt to agree upon a mutually satisfactory mediator.  The parties and the mediator shall meet at an agreeable time and place within 15 days of the mediator’s selection in an attempt to mediate the dispute.  The mediator will select the time and place for the meeting and may, at his or her option, select another mediator for assistance.  The parties and mediator will conduct the mediation with the intent that the matter be jointly settled at the time and a written agreement between the parties be drafted and signed.  If either party does not agree with the solutions, either party may then request that the matter proceed to arbitration.  If there is a cost for the mediation it shall be shared equally between LANDLORD and TENANT.   Excepting only any signed settlement agreement or written documents voluntarily disclosed during the mediation, the contents of any communications between the participants and/or mediator shall be absolutely privileged and shall not be admissible during any trial or arbitration, except as otherwise permitted by Oregon laws.

C.	ARBITRATION.   If mutually agreed to by all parties, any dispute that is not resolved through mediation may be submitted to arbitration.  Both parties shall attempt to agree on a single arbitrator.  If the parties are unable to do so, each party shall select its own arbitrator, the two chosen arbitrators shall then select a third arbitrator.  The costs of arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties.  The arbitrator(s) will schedule and conduct a hearing.  Within 10 business days of the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator(s) shall serve written notice of the decision on the parties.  The arbitration decision shall be final and binding in accordance with Oregon Law.  The failure to pay any advance deposit, fee or charge required by a mediator or arbitrator shall be deemed a waiver of the right to mediate or arbitrate.

D.	MATTERS NOT SUBJECT TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (“ADR”).   The mediation and arbitration provisions of this Addendum shall not apply to the following matters:  Closure of the park; sale of the park; rent (including but not limited to, amount, increase or non-payment of rent); or those matters for which a non-curable notice of termination may be given to TENANT under Oregon Law.  LANDLORD shall have the right to issue a notice for termination prior to asking for ADR or even after TENANT has asked for ADR.  Entering into ADR does not mean that LANDLORD has a duty to permit or waive any violations of  Oregon Law, the Park Rules or the Rental Agreement.  If, after issuance of a notice of termination, TENANT fails or refuses to request ADR of the matter within the time set forth in the notice, and LANDLORD files for eviction, TENANT shall be conclusively presumed to have waived the right to thereafter request ADR.

By Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC - MHCO Legal Counsel

1. 	Generally 

	1.1 	PCQ Observations:

1.1.1 	The law recognizes that upon abandonment, there are six primary interests: (1) the tenant, (2) the landlord, (3) the owner (if different from the tenant); (4) the lienholder, if any, (5) the tax collector and (6) the tax assessor. (Note also, that the estate of a deceased tenant/owner residing alone is afforded much of the protections now provided to lienholders.) 

1.1.2 	What follows is a summary of the abandonment laws.  However, this material should not be relied upon in lieu of a thorough review of the law itself and consultation with legal counsel.

2. 	When abandonment may be declared:

2.1 	The tenancy has ended by termination or expiration of the Rental/Lease Agreement, or by surrender or abandonment, and the landlord reasonably believes that the tenant has no intention of asserting any further claim to the premises; or,

2.2 	The tenant has been absent from the premises continuously for at least seven (7) days following a court ordered termination that has not been executed upon the by sheriff; or,

2.3 	The landlord receives possession of the premises from the sheriff following execution after a Notice of Restitution has been served.  See, ORS 105.161

2.4 	If the manufactured or floating home is left on the premises, the storage and sale process described in ORS 90.425 (for homes outside of a facility) and 90.675 (for homes inside a facility) must be followed. Any costs incurred by the landlord for execution of the judgment of restitution or for removal, storage or sale of the tenants' property and not recovered pursuant to the public sale provisions of those statutes ""shall be added to the judgment."" 

3. 	Where abandoned personal property and manufactured and floating homes may be stored: 

3.1 	Subject only to limited exceptions regarding abandoned automobiles or special agreement with the tenant, it must be ""at a place of safekeeping."" 

3.2 	Manufactured and floating homes must be left upon the rented space. 

4. 	The 45-day advance written notice from landlord to tenant before selling or disposing of abandoned property must be personally served, or sent by first class mail, addressed and mailed to the tenant at the premises, with copies to any post office box and forwarding address actually known by the landlord. 

5. 	If the abandoned property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, a copy of the notice must be sent, via personal delivery or first class mail to: 

5.1 	Any lienholders actually known to the landlord as well as any lienholders ""of record."" However, the notice must also be sent to any address provided to the landlord in a written notice identifying the home and space that was received from the lienholder within the preceding five (5) years; 

5.2 	Any owners, if different from the tenant;

5.3 	Tax collector of the county where the RV, manufactured home or vehicle is 
located; and 

5.4 	The assessor of the county where the property is located. 

6. 	Contents of the written notice sent to the tenant, lienholder and owner must inform of the following: 

6.1 	That the personal property is considered abandoned; 

6.2 	That they must contact the landlord by a specified date to arrange for removal: 

6.3 	For RVs, manufactured and floating homes, this cannot be less than 45 days after personal delivery or first class mailing of the notice 

6.4 	The property will be stored in a place of safekeeping, which in the case of an RV, manufactured or floating home shall be the rented space; 

6.5 	Recipient(s) may arrange for removal by contacting the landlord at a described telephone number or address on or before the specified date; 


6.6 	Note that if the personal property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, the tenant may not remove it if :(i) the lienholder has foreclosed its lien; (ii) the tenant has waived their rights in writing in a good faith agreement with the landlord not more than 7 days prior to termination of the tenancy; or (iii) the applicable time for the tenant to respond has expired. 

6.7 	The landlord will make the personal property available for removal by the tenant or any lienholder or owner by appointment at reasonable times. 

6.8 	The landlord may require payment of storage charges prior to releasing the personal property. (Note: The storage charges shall not exceed the latest monthly space rent last payable by the tenant.) 

6.9 	If the property is considered abandoned as a result of the execution of a Judgment of Restitution, the landlord shall not require payment of storage charges prior to releasing the property. 

6.10 	If they fail to contact the landlord within the specified time, or after making contact with the landlord, fail to remove the home within: (a) 30 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes; or (b) 15 days for all other personal property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property. (Note: the 30-day period applies to RVs, and manufactured and floating homes located in or out of a facility.) 

6.11 	If the landlord reasonably believes the county assessor will determine that the ""current market value"" of the personal property is $8,000 or less, and the landlord intends to dispose of the property if it is not claimed, the notice shall state that belief and intent. (""Current market value"" is defined to mean"" ... the amount in cash, as determined by the county assessor that could reasonably be expected to be paid for (the home) by an informed buyer to an informed seller .... "") 

6.12 	If applicable, there is a lienholder that has a right to claim the property if otherwise qualified under ORS 90.675; 

7. 	After sending the written notification, the landlord shall store the personal property as follows: 

7.1 	Manufactured or floating homes: On the rented space or slip, exercising reasonable care; 

7.2 	All other abandoned personal property, including goods left inside an RV, manufactured or floating home, upon the rented space outside of said home, in a place of safekeeping, exercising reasonable care. 

7.2.1 	Exceptions for rotting food and abandoned pets or livestock. 

7.2.2 May be stored at the dwelling unit, commercial storage or other place of safekeeping. 

8. 	Upon receipt of the written notice, the tenant, lienholder or owner may respond within the 45 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes or the 5 to 8 day period described above for all other personal property. The landlord must make the property available within the next 30 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes and 15 days for all other abandoned personal property. 

8.1 	If the tenant, lienholder or owner fail to respond, or are late in responding, the personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned and they shall have no further right to the property. 

8.2 	PCQ Note: This does not mean that they do not have any right to distribution of any sale proceeds. They still do! 

8.3 	After the property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned, the landlord may: 

8.3.1 	Destroy or otherwise dispose of the home if the landlord determines from the county assessor that the current market value is $8,000 or less. 

8.3.2 	Otherwise, the landlord must conduct a public or private sale as follows; 

8.3.2.1 	If the property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, the 
landlord may seek to transfer the certificate of title and registration by complying with the requirements of the Building Codes Division of the Oregon Department of Business and Consumer Services, in the case of manufactured or floating homes, or the State Marine Board, in the case of floating homes. 

8.3.2.2 	Additionally, if the property is an RV, manufactured or floating 
home (and market value is $8,000 or more), the landlord must do the following:
 
8.3.2.2.1 	Advertise the sale in a newspaper of general circulation where the RV or home is located. 

8.3.2.2.2 	At a reasonable time prior to the sale, give a copy of the newspaper notice to the tenant and any lienholder or owner by personal delivery or first class mail (or in the case of a lienholder, with a certificate of mailing). 

8.3.2.2.3 	Obtain an Affidavit of Publication from the newspaper showing that the notice ran at least one day for each of two consecutive weeks prior to the date of the sale or the last date bids will be accepted. 

8.3.2.2.4 	Obtain written proof from the county that all property taxes on the manufactured or floating home have been paid, or if not paid, that the County 
has authorized the sale. 

9. 	Conduct of the sale. 

9.1 	For RVs, manufactured or floating homes, the method, manner, time, place and terms of the sale must be commercially reasonable and conform to the information contained in the landlord's published notice. 

9.2 	For all other property the sale must be in accordance with ORS 79.5040 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”). 

10. 	Treatment of the proceeds of sale: 

10.1 	If there is no buyer at the sale, the property is automatically considered to be worth $8,000 or less, regardless of current market value, and the landlord may destroy or otherwise dispose of the personal property. 

10.2 	The landlord may deduct: 

10.2.1 	The reasonable or actual cost of notice, storage and sale, and 

10.2.2 	Unpaid rent. 

10.2.3 	The remaining proceeds are to be distributed according to the following priorities:

10.2.3.1 	County tax collector (manufactured or floating homes only); 

10.2.3.2 	Any lienholder to the extent of any unpaid balance owned; 

10.2.3.3   The balance to the tenant or owner, with an itemized accounting. 

10.2.4 	If the tenant or owner cannot, after due diligence, be found, the proceeds are to be deposited with the treasurer of the County where the sale occurred, and if not claimed within 3 years they revert to the county. 

11. 	The county tax collector shall cancel all unpaid property taxes if: 

11.1 	The landlord disposes of the property after the county assessor has determined that the current market value is $8,000 or less; 

11.2 There is no buyer at the sale;

11.3 	The current market value is $8,000 or less, there is a buyer at the sale, but the proceeds of sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes owed on the home after distribution of the proceeds pursuant to statute (i.e. first to the landlord for actual costs of sale and storage charges, then to the tax assessor and next to the lienholder and last, to the tenant.). 

11.4 	The landlord buys the property at the sale, the current market value is more than $8,000, the proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the property taxes, and the landlord disposes of the home.
11.5 	PCQ Comment: Realistically, landlords who intend to bid at the auction of a home with a tax assessor determined fair market value in excess of $8,000, should plan on paying the unpaid property taxes if they acquire the home at the sale, since those taxes will not be cancelled. 

12. 	If the landlord fails to comply with the abandonment statute, the tenant is relieved of liability for any non-deliberate or non-negligent damage to the premises and for unpaid space rent and the landlord may be held liable for twice the tenant's actual damages. 

12.1 	Lienholders may recover actual damages from the landlord (but not attorney fees). 

12.2 	The county tax assessor may recover actual damages (but not attorney fees) in cases of landlord fraud. 

13. 	Special rights of lienholders in manufactured and floating homes:

13.1 	Within the 45-day period, the lienholder may request that the landlord enter into written agreement that the dwelling or home not be sold or disposed of for up to 12 months, so long as the lienholder makes timely periodic payment of all storage charges and maintains the dwelling or home and the rented space on which it is stored. 

13.2 	Lienholders have 60 days to sign and return the storage agreement. The law permits - with specific limitations - the right to include certain utility charges, late charges, and increased the storage charges. The landlord's right to storage fees accrues from the commencement of the 45-day period. Also, if the landlord wants any physical defects repaired, they must be reasonably described in the storage agreement. There are other limitations if the home was placed on the space within the previous 24 months. The repairs must be completed within 90 days and if not, the agreement may be terminated with 14 days' written notice.) 

13.3 	During the storage agreement period, the lienholder has the right to remove the property, but now must give not less than 14 days advance written notice. All storage charges must be paid before such removal. 

13.5 	The lienholder may sell the manufactured dwelling or floating home on site, subject to any terms previously agreed upon between the landlord and tenant, or if no agreement, any reasonable conditions imposed by the landlord. In the case of manufactured or floating homes located within facilities, ORS 90.680 applies, which permits landlords to apply their existing tenant screening criteria. 

13.6 	If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate it upon 90 days' written notice, during which time the lienholder may cure the default. If the default pertains to the nonpayment of a storage charge and the lienholder cures, but defaults a second time, the cure period is reduced to 30 days. If the lienholder fails to timely cure, the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling without further notice to the lienholder. 

13.7 	Upon termination of the storage agreement, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, or the lienholder has sold or removed the home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice. (Note: This does not mean that the landlord must go through the entire notice procedure again; the sale procedures must be followed if the market value is above $8,000.) 

14. 	If the personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession such as an heir or devisee, timely requests within the 45-day period, they may enter into a written agreement with the landlord that the home not be sold or disposed of for up to 90 days or the conclusion of probate, whichever is longer, so long as storage charges are paid and the space is maintained. If the landlord knows the identity of any personal representative or designated person, a copy of the 45-day letter should be sent to them. (The original 45-day letter should be addressed in the name of the personal representative or designated person and mailed to the premises in the community. Don’t address the notice in the name of the deceased tenant!) 

15. 	A landlord shall not, as a condition of approving an on-site sale, require a tenant or lienholder to waive any rights created under the abandonment law. 

16. 	Homes posing extreme health or safety hazards. (The specifics of the statute should be closely reviewed.) 

16.1 	If a governmental agency declares a home an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law there is an expedited mailing and removal process. 

16.2 The 45-day letter has been reduced to 15 days. 

16.3 The response/removal time is 7 days. 

16.4 There is no lienholder right to enter into a storage agreement.

8.3.2.2.2 	At a reasonable time prior to the sale, give a copy of the newspaper notice to the tenant and any lienholder or owner by personal delivery or first class mail (or in the case of a lienholder, with a certificate of mailing). 

8.3.2.2.3 	Obtain an Affidavit of Publication from the newspaper showing that the notice ran at least one day for each of two consecutive weeks prior to the date of the sale or the last date bids will be accepted. 

8.3.2.2.4 	Obtain written proof from the county that all property taxes on the manufactured or floating home have been paid, or if not paid, that the County 
has authorized the sale. 

9. 	Conduct of the sale. 

9.1 	For RVs, manufactured or floating homes, the method, manner, time, place and terms of the sale must be commercially reasonable and conform to the information contained in the landlord's published notice. 

9.2 	For all other property the sale must be in accordance with ORS 79.5040 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”). 

10. 	Treatment of the proceeds of sale: 

10.1 	If there is no buyer at the sale, the property is automatically considered to be worth $8,000 or less, regardless of current market value, and the landlord may destroy or otherwise dispose of the personal property. 

10.2 	The landlord may deduct: 

10.2.1 	The reasonable or actual cost of notice, storage and sale, and 

10.2.2 	Unpaid rent. 

10.2.3 	The remaining proceeds are to be distributed according to the following priorities:

10.2.3.1 	County tax collector (manufactured or floating homes only); 

10.2.3.2 	Any lienholder to the extent of any unpaid balance owned; 

10.2.3.3   The balance to the tenant or owner, with an itemized accounting. 

10.2.4 	If the tenant or owner cannot, after due diligence, be found, the proceeds are to be deposited with the treasurer of the County where the sale occurred, and if not claimed within 3 years they revert to the county. 

11. 	The county tax collector shall cancel all unpaid property taxes if: 

11.1 	The landlord disposes of the property after the county assessor has determined that the current market value is $8,000 or less; 

11.2 There is no buyer at the sale;

11.3 	The current market value is $8,000 or less, there is a buyer at the sale, but the proceeds of sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes owed on the home after distribution of the proceeds pursuant to statute (i.e. first to the landlord for actual costs of sale and storage charges, then to the tax assessor and next to the lienholder and last, to the tenant.). 

11.4 	The landlord buys the property at the sale, the current market value is more than $8,000, the proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the property taxes, and the landlord disposes of the home.
11.5 	PCQ Comment: Realistically, landlords who intend to bid at the auction of a home with a tax assessor determined fair market value in excess of $8,000, should plan on paying the unpaid property taxes if they acquire the home at the sale, since those taxes will not be cancelled. 

12. 	If the landlord fails to comply with the abandonment statute, the tenant is relieved of liability for any non-deliberate or non-negligent damage to the premises and for unpaid space rent and the landlord may be held liable for twice the tenant's actual damages. 

12.1 	Lienholders may recover actual damages from the landlord (but not attorney fees). 

12.2 	The county tax assessor may recover actual damages (but not attorney fees) in cases of landlord fraud. 

13. 	Special rights of lienholders in manufactured and floating homes:

13.1 	Within the 45-day period, the lienholder may request that the landlord enter into written agreement that the dwelling or home not be sold or disposed of for up to 12 months, so long as the lienholder makes timely periodic payment of all storage charges and maintains the dwelling or home and the rented space on which it is stored. 

13.2 	Lienholders have 60 days to sign and return the storage agreement. The law permits - with specific limitations - the right to include certain utility charges, late charges, and increased the storage charges. The landlord's right to storage fees accrues from the commencement of the 45-day period. Also, if the landlord wants any physical defects repaired, they must be reasonably described in the storage agreement. There are other limitations if the home was placed on the space within the previous 24 months. The repairs must be completed within 90 days and if not, the agreement may be terminated with 14 days' written notice.) 

13.3 	During the storage agreement period, the lienholder has the right to remove the property, but now must give not less than 14 days advance written notice. All storage charges must be paid before such removal. 

13.5 	The lienholder may sell the manufactured dwelling or floating home on site, subject to any terms previously agreed upon between the landlord and tenant, or if no agreement, any reasonable conditions imposed by the landlord. In the case of manufactured or floating homes located within facilities, ORS 90.680 applies, which permits landlords to apply their existing tenant screening criteria. 

13.6 	If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate it upon 90 days' written notice, during which time the lienholder may cure the default. If the default pertains to the nonpayment of a storage charge and the lienholder cures, but defaults a second time, the cure period is reduced to 30 days. If the lienholder fails to timely cure, the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling without further notice to the lienholder. 

13.7 	Upon termination of the storage agreement, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, or the lienholder has sold or removed the home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice. (Note: This does not mean that the landlord must go through the entire notice procedure again; the sale procedures must be followed if the market value is above $8,000.) 

14. 	If the personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession such as an heir or devisee, timely requests within the 45-day period, they may enter into a written agreement with the landlord that the home not be sold or disposed of for up to 90 days or the conclusion of probate, whichever is longer, so long as storage charges are paid and the space is maintained. If the landlord knows the identity of any personal representative or designated person, a copy of the 45-day letter should be sent to them. (The original 45-day letter should be addressed in the name of the personal representative or designated person and mailed to the premises in the community. Don’t address the notice in the name of the deceased tenant!) 

15. 	A landlord shall not, as a condition of approving an on-site sale, require a tenant or lienholder to waive any rights created under the abandonment law. 

16. 	Homes posing extreme health or safety hazards. (The specifics of the statute should be closely reviewed.) 

16.1 	If a governmental agency declares a home an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law there is an expedited mailing and removal process. 

16.2 The 45-day letter has been reduced to 15 days. 

16.3 The response/removal time is 7 days. 

16.4 There is no lienholder right to enter into a storage agreement.

"226","226","1","How Not to Conduct an Abandonment","By Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC - MHCO Legal Counsel 

Currently, Oregon law provides that upon receipt of a copy of the abandonment letter that is sent to a tenant, the lienholder has 45 days to contact the landlord to make arrangements for storage and resale of the home. If the lienholder signs a storage agreement with the landlord, it may then market the home for resale for up to 12 months. If the lienholder fails to make the necessary contact within the 4S-days and sign the storage agreement, the law “conclusively presumes” that the lien has been abandoned. The same conclusive presumption applies to the tenant following expiration of the 45-day period after the landlord’s mailing of the abandonment letter. 

Many landlords erroneously believe that following a tenant's abandonment they can forgo the necessity of the 45-day letter and simply contact the lienholder to make arrangements for payment of the monthly storage fees. Sometimes lienholders cooperate with this informal process, and sometimes they don't. Cooperation usually takes one of two forms: (a) The lienholder signs a ""storage agreement"" and commences making the monthly payments; or, (b) The lienholder signs nothing, but makes the monthly payments anyway. Both of these alternatives are incorrect and could place the landlord in legal jeopardy.   Sending of the 45-day letter is an essential element of commencing the abandonment process legally.

By not sending the 45-day day letter to the tenant and all of the other parties required by law, the abandonment is not legally ""triggered."" Since Oregon law is quite clear that a tenant's abandoned manufactured home may only be disposed of pursuant to the procedures set forth in ORS 90.675, the use of ""shortcuts"" creates a risk on several fronts. First, even though the lienholder may make the payments, the 45-days has not legally commenced, since the triggering event never occurred. Secondly, without sending the 45-day letter to the tenant - even if though they truly abandoned the property - the tenant has never been legally notified of the landlord's intention. 

Additionally, there is always the risk that someone other than the tenant is the record owner of the home. This can only be determined by a check with the Division of Finance and Corporate Securities (“DFCS”). Thus dealing with the lienholder directly, and ignoring the rights of the tenant and perhaps the real owner of the home, means that their rights will not have been legally divested once the home is resold by the lienholder. 

This same problem holds true for other lienholders who may appear on the DFCS records. By dealing with one lienholder, but not notifying the other, the rights of the ignored lienholder have not been divested.  In other words, by not following the abandonment statute to the letter, and failing to give the 45 day letter to all of the people and entities required by the statute, the landlord is at risk that an ignored party will later appear to re-claim either their property or assert their lien rights. 

Substantially the same issue exists when the 45-day letter is not sent to the tax collector or tax assessor. However, since title to the home cannot be transferred without a Form 113 verifying that the taxes have either been paid or waived, this problem usually appears before the home is sold to someone else. 

Thus, if the abandonment is not legally commenced, those who have a right to notification, but do not receive it, have a claim against the landlord.  Here is one doomsday scenario: 

•	Tenant abandons the home and the Landlord contacts Lienholder who immediately commences paying the monthly storage fees;
•	No 45-day letter is sent to anyone; 
•	Lienholder signs a storage agreement and finds a buyer; 
•	The home is sold to buyer, title is transferred, and buyer moves in; 
•	Tenant later finds out about the sale, claims that the home was worth far more than what it was sold for, and had he been notified of the abandonment, would have either sold it or at least let it go to auction and recovered back some of his ""equity""; 
•	Notwithstanding the fact that the tenant may have never entertained any intention of making any claim to the home after he left, the fact remains that his home was taken without following the letter of the law. The Landlord's only excuse for proceeding in the manner he did was that the Lienholder cooperated early in the process by making the storage payments when requested. The Tenant has the Landlord over a legal barrel, and there is really no legal defense to the claim - the abandonment statute was ignored in favor of the opportunity of receiving storage fees immediately. [Most jurors have been tenants at one time or another and would be much more sympathetic to the Tenant than the Landlord in this case.] 

The danger with this scenario is that oftentimes the landlord does not realize that they have done anything wrong - and in fact, believes that the tenant's abandonment has posed few problems for them, since the lienholder stepped up so quickly. However, all of this ignores the fact that the tenant has an outstanding claim that may not arise until months later, and the problem could easily have been avoided had the abandonment been initiated according to the law in the first place. 

Here is another doomsday scenario: 

•	Tenant abandons the home; 
•	Landlord contacts Lienholder who says it will start paying the storage fees which are $400 per month;
•	Landlord sends Lienholder a storage agreement;
•	Nothing happens. Three months go by. Landlord calls and writes Lienholder who finally says they never got the storage agreement, please send another one;
•	Another three months goes by. Finally, the issue gets to someone in the Lienholder's company who actually knows and understands ORS 90.675. They politely tell the Landlord that they have not properly commenced the abandonment - i.e. no 45-day letter has been sent to the tenant, with a copy to the Lienholder, or anyone else as required by statute - and therefore the 45-day period within which to sign the storage agreement has not even started. 
•	Landlord goes to an attorney who commences a legal abandonment. This means that the Landlord has lost six months' rent totaling $2,400 and if the Lienholder waits the full 45 days before exercising its rights, another one and one-half months (i.e. $600 more, for a total of $3,000) has been lost.1 
•	This scenario is even more outrageous if the Lienholder notifies the Landlord that they do not want to exercise their right to sign a storage agreement and abandons their right to the home. If the Landlord sent the 45-day letter out at the moment of entitlement and the Lienholder were forced to make the decision to abandon their lien earlier, the maximum loss would have been approximately two months' rent, and possibly less, depending upon the value of the home.2

In no event should landlords negotiate directly with lienholders for payment of the storage fees (with or without the use of a storage agreement) unless and until the 45-day letter has been sent to the lienholder, owner, and all of the other parties required to be notified under Oregon law.

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Published: Friday, February 24, 2012, 10:30 PM     Updated: Saturday, February 25, 2012, 9:56 AM Helen Jung, The Oregonian By Helen Jung, The Oregonian The Oregonian</p>
<p>When the Sazykin family's 14-year-old son rode his scooter on pathways around the Wah Mai Terrace Apartments complex in Southeast Portland, the apartment manager fined his parents $20.</p>
<p>When they left their children's play furniture and other items out on the patio, the apartment manager issued a few warnings and then another $20 fine.</p>
<p>The family's actions violated apartment policies, according to a complaint filed last September in Multnomah County Circuit Court.  But under an agreement with the state announced Friday, the apartment complex and its property management firm will pay nearly $65,000 to tenants, the state and a legal aid organization. They will have to ditch policies that tenants criticized as discriminating against families.</p>
<p>And they will have to install a playground structure.</p>
<p>""It's a really good (result) for families in Oregon,"" said Christina Dirks, who represented the Sazykins, one of several families who made claims against the apartment complex and property management firm Norris &amp; Stevens. ""It's helping to assure that families in our community have equal access to enjoy their rental housing.""</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Wah Mai Terrace and Norris &amp; Stevens, do not admit any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Norris &amp; Stevens representatives did not return a call for comment.</p>
<p>Jonathan Radmacher, an attorney for the Wah Mai Terrace owners, said the policies were never meant to be anti-children.</p>
<p>He noted that the apartment complex owners and property managers were quick to address the problems as soon as they were brought up.</p>
<p>The policy that barred tenants from storing items other than bikes and barbecue grills on their patios was to keep the look of the complex presentable and clean, Radmacher said.  The policy that prohibited children from riding bikes, tricycles, Big Wheel-type toys, skateboards and rollerskates on the property was out of concern for older residents, he said.</p>
<p>""There are lots of places to play in the neighborhood,"" he said, noting Ventura Park and Floyd Light Middle School, both about a block or two away from the complex at SE 111th and SE Stark.</p>
<p>He criticized the state, saying that the apartment complex and property managers were not aware of the discrimination concerns until the state intervened and threatened them with tens of thousands of dollars in state legal fees.  ""I know my client would never want to have any policy that's discriminatory... They would always want that brought to their attention, and they would fix it,"" he said.  About $35,000 of the settlement will go to six current and former tenants. Norris &amp; Stevens and Wah Mai Terrace also must pay attorney fees and costs of $20,000 to the Oregon Department of Justice and $9,816.36 to Legal Aid Services of Oregon.</p>
<p>Representatives for the two entities must participate in training on fair housing practices.</p>
<p>They also cannot try to collect fines and other debts that were levied against tenants under the “potentially unlawful” policies.</p>
<p>Norris &amp; Stevens, which manages 8,300 units throughout the Portland area, will adopt the revised policies at all properties in its portfolio, and not just to the Wah Mai Terrace Complex, the state said.</p>
<p>The change helps families — particularly low-income families – who don’t have the means to just pick up and move elsewhere, said Dirks, a staff attorney with Legal Aid Services of Oregon.   The rental market, as well, offers few options.</p>
<p>The Portland market is tied with Minneapolis for having the second-lowest vacancy rate in the nation, according to a survey of the National Association of Realtors.  --Helen Jung</p>","<p><strong><br></strong></p>",,"1343766388","2"
"229","229","3","Limited Dealer License and new Federal Laws on Financing  (SAFE) when Selling an Abandoned Home","<p>Question:  According to MHCO’s recent SAFE Act article authored by Phil Querin (uploaded 12/6/2011, MHCO.ORG ""Community Updates""), a park owner wishing to sell abandoned homes on site may do so with a limited dealer’s license if they either: (a) Are licensed as a mortgage banker or broker; or, (b) Secure the services of a Mortgage Loan Originator (“MLO”).  Where do you find a MLO that can prepare loan documents in the Portland area?  Can their cost be included in the loan or can a loan origination fee be charged for their services.  If so, could MHCO issue a list of MLO's and their charges? What would I have to do to become a licensed MLO for my park?</p>
<p>Answer:  My prior article indicated that park owners holding a limited dealer’s license are subject to regulation under the SAFE Act if they “carry the paper”, i.e. enter into a retail installment contract with the tenant-purchaser.  This is because when they do so, they are making a “credit decision” about their buyer.   Park owners have two choices:</p>
<p>1.	Hire a MLO who will engage in the activities described for them under state law.  This will require the park owner to become either a mortgage banker or mortgage broker.  The reason for this is because the MLO is required to work under the supervision and control of one or the other.</p>
<p>2.	Contract with an existing MLO who is already working for an Oregon licensed mortgage banker or broker.  Presumably, this would be on an independent contractor basis.</p>
<p>The second alternative is likely more attractive in most cases, since it avoids the cost of securing a special license and then becoming an employer, with all of the regulation that this entails.  If you are interested in learning more about becoming a mortgage banker or mortgage broker, you should go the website for the Department of Consumer and Business Services (“DCBS”) here.</p>
<p>This means that your next best solution is to contract with a mortgage banker or broker to secure the services of their MLO on an independent contractor or similar basis.  MLOs are employed by mortgage bankers or brokers – they are not separately licensed as such. This means that you cannot “become” a MLO unless you want to work for a mortgage banker or broker.</p>
<p>MHCO is currently evaluating the idea of a referral list. However, as you imply, the entire lending industry is not without its own liability issues.  Accordingly, the decision to actually publish a referral list – and the implicit “endorsement” risk that comes with doing so – is something we may ultimately decline to do.  In the meantime, we suggest that you contact other MHCO members and Associate members. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the issue of costs, we know of no restrictions on recovery of loan fees and costs that are unique to MLOs.  This is not to say that the sky’s the limit, because you do not want to charge for services not actually performed, or in amounts that are not customary.  If in doubt, you should contact the DCBS at (503) 378-4100.</p>
<p>As for trying to recover the cost of the MLO as a part of the closing cost of the sale, I do not know for sure and suggest you contact the DCBS.  Alternatively, you may wish to consider simply building the cost of the MLO into the resale price of the home.  This would avoid any regulatory issues entirely.</p>
<p>Lastly, I note that your question asks about finding …”a MLO that can prepare loan documents…”  As stated in my prior SAFE article for MHCO, a loan originator is the individual whose primary job responsibilities include negotiating with a potential borrower for the purpose of establishing the terms and conditions of a mortgage loan.  <em>A loan originator does not include an individual whose responsibilities are clerical or administrative, such as gathering information, requesting information, word processing, soliciting general interest in mortgage loans, sending correspondence and assembling files.</em> Accordingly, it is my opinion that the task of “preparing loan documents” is not really something you need to pay the MLO to do.  It is discretionary functions, such as credit evaluation and negotiation of terms, that are reserved to MLOs. The merely administrative tasks can be performed by others, even your own employees or managers.</p>","<p>Question:  According to MHCO’s recent SAFE Act article authored by Phil Querin (uploaded 12/6/2011, MHCO.ORG ""Community Updates""), a park owner wishing to sell abandoned homes on site may do so with a limited dealer’s license if they either: (a) Are licensed as a mortgage banker or broker; or, (b) Secure the services of a Mortgage Loan Originator (“MLO”).

"232","232","1","State of Oregon Question & Answers and FACTS on the SAFE ACT","<p><strong>Why is a mortgage loan originator (“MLO”) license required?</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, the Federal government passed the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (SAFE Act) that mandated that states begin licensing mortgage loan originators.  The SAFE Act set the minimum licensing requirements that states must comply with in their licensing programs.</p>
<p><strong>When is a MLO license required?</strong></p>
<p>A mortgage loan originator license is required to take an application for a residential mortgage loan or for offering or negotiating the terms of a residential mortgage loan.  There are very few exceptions to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Are there a maximum number of transactions I can do before I have to get a mortgage loan originator license?</strong></p>
<p>There is no de minimus transaction exception.  If a mortgage loan originator license is required, even one transaction requires a license.</p>
<p><strong>Can I just get a temporary license?</strong></p>
<p>No, there is no temporary license available.</p>
<p><strong>Does the license requirement apply to a manufactured home?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the definition of “dwelling” used in the SAFE Act includes manufactured homes whether or not they are attached to real property.  Thus, financing to purchase a manufactured home in a park setting would still be subject to the licensing requirements.</p>
<p><strong>If I have a manufactured structures dealer license, do I also need a MLO license to offer financing on homes in my park?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  The manufactured structure dealer license does not exempt the holder from the mortgage loan originator licensing requirement.  You would need to have a mortgage loan originator license to take an application for financing or to negotiate the terms of the financing with the purchaser.</p>
<p><strong>Does an employee of a licensed manufactured structure dealer have to have an MLO license when the mobile home park wants to sell abandoned or surrender structures and provide financing for the transaction?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  There is no MLO license required to sell the home, but a MLO license would be required to take the application and negotiate financing for the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>If a manufactured home park owner does a rent-to-own transaction, is the owner required to have an MLO license to handle it?</strong></p>
<p>No.  Rent-to-own contracts that do not contain financing terms do not fall within the scope of MLO licensing requirements to have a mortgage loan originator negotiate the terms.</p>
<p><strong>I’m selling my residence and the buyer wants me to provide the financing.  Do I need a license?</strong> No. ORS 86A.203(2)(c) provides an exception from the MLO license requirements for an individual providing financing as part of the sale of the individual’s residence.  Therefore, no MLO license would be required.</p>
<p><strong>I am selling my investment property and I have been told that I need a MLO license to tell the borrower my terms for financing the sale.  Where does the SAFE Act state that I need a MLO license?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>You will not find a statute that that expressly states you must tell the borrower your terms for financing the sale.  The MLO licensing requirements apply expressly and by implication to loan origination activities.  It is the absence of an exception that requires the seller to obtain the license to provide financing for an investment property.  Specifically, ORS 86A.200(4) defines a loan originator as a person who, for compensation or gain, takes an application or negotiates terms of the loan.  It does not provide an exception to the definition for those providing seller carry financing.  In addition, ORS 86A.203 requires that loan originators obtain license.  While there is an exception to the license requirement for a seller providing seller-carry financing, that exception is limited to financing on a property that was the seller’s residence.  Because there is no exception that covers investment property, the license requirement applies to those transactions.</p>
<p><strong>I am a licensed mortgage loan originator, and I communicated the seller’s original terms to the buyer, who declined them.  Can the seller and buyer then negotiate from that point on by themselves?</strong></p>
<p>Only a licensed mortgage loan originator can negotiate or discuss the terms with the buyer in a seller-carry transaction that is not the seller's residence.  This means that the licensed mortgage loan originator would have to negotiate the transaction until the negotiations are complete.</p>
<p><strong>I want to offer a rent-to-own contract in which I agree to give the renter a credit toward the down payment.  Do I need a MLO license?</strong></p>
<p>If the contract does not provide terms for financing the purchase of the home, then a MLO license is not required.  If the renter needs a loan to buy the home, and the seller made that loan, then a licensed mortgage loan originator would be needed to facilitate the transaction if the property was not previously the seller’s residence.</p>
<p><strong>I want to make a private money loan with my own funds for my own investment. In the past I did not need a MLO license, do I need a license now?</strong></p>
<p>There are two different license requirements that must be analyzed: a mortgage broker/banker (company) license and a mortgage loan originator (individual) license.  ORS 86A.100(3)(b)(C) and (5)(b)(F) continue to provide a limited exemption from the requirement to obtain a company license.  Without obtaining a company license, an individual can make up to 10 loans a year using his own money for his own investment purposes as long as he does not hold himself to be “in the business” of making loans.  Thus, the individual may not have a commercial business location for making loans, may not advertise that he makes loans and must make the loan in his own name.  Although a company license is not required for an individual investor to make a limited number of loans, there is no corresponding exemption for a MLO license.  An individual must have a MLO license to make these loans or use a licensed loan originator to facilitate the loan.</p>
<p><strong>As an investor making a private money loan, can I have multiple loan originators originate the loans for me or do I always have to use the same loan originator?</strong></p>
<p><strong>An investor may work with different loan originators and different mortgage companies in making private money loans. If the loan is secured by the borrower’s residence but the loan is for a business purpose, is a mortgage loan originator license required?</strong></p>
<p>A MLO license is required for a business loan secured by the borrower’s residence because licensing is based upon the type of property.  The purpose of the funds is irrelevant.  Thus, a mortgage loan originator license is required even if the loan is a business loan.</p>
<p><strong>Is either the company or the MLO license required to lend on any type of property?</strong></p>
<p>A company or MLO license is not required for all types of all types of property; the licensing requirements are tied to  residential mortgage loans, which are loans secured by residential one to four family property, or land upon which it is planned to build residential one to four family property.  The licensing requirements apply to bare land and construction loans if the property is to have a one to four family home built on it.  For instance, a loan to a person buying a lot to build their home on would a loan be a covered transaction and would require a license.  Commercial or multi-family properties in excess of four family units do not require either the company or mortgage loan originator license.</p>
<p><strong>How do I apply for a MLO license?</strong></p>
<p>The application must be submitted through the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS).  You can find additional information at http://mortgage.nationwidelicensingsystem.org/Pages/default.aspx and our frequently asked licensing questions at http://www.oregondfcs.org/ml/faq.html.</p>
<p><strong>What is the potential fine for unlicensed activity?</strong></p>
<p>The potential fine for unlicensed loan originator activity would be the same $5,000 per occurrence that applies for all other violations of Chapter 86 of the Oregon Revised Statutes.</p>
<p><strong>When did the licensing requirements go into effect?</strong></p>
<p>The requirements went into effect August 1, 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Does this have to be a “full doc” transaction?</strong></p>
<p>We do not require the file to be a full doc file in the conventional sense of that term; however, we require that the file comply with the private money investor requirements of OAR 441-870-0050 and OAR 441-870-0060 as well as OAR 441-865-0060.</p>
<p><strong>Does Oregon law require analysis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan?</strong></p>
<p>Oregon law requires an analysis of a borrower’s ability to repay the loan if the loan contains provisions for negative amortization.  Oregon also enforces certain federal laws, including the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). TILA contains an ability–to-repay test for high-cost mortgage loans and higher-priced mortgage loans.  Thus, Oregon will require an analysis of ability to repay for any loan that is subject to TILA and that Act’s requirements to determine ability to repay.</p>
<p><strong>Can a licensed mortgage originator collect the fee for originating a private money loan, or does the fee need to be paid to the company sponsoring that mortgage loan originator?</strong></p>
<p>The mortgage loan originator is only authorized to do loans through the company that sponsors the MLO’s license; therefore, the transaction is really done in the company's name.  The company is required to supervise the MLO and is responsible for the transaction.  Although Oregon law is fairly silent on the issue of collecting the fee, it is anticipated that the companies will collect the fee due to the supervision requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any limits on the fees that can be charged for facilitating a private money transaction?</strong></p>
<p>There are no specified limits in Oregon law on the fees that can be charged.</p>

	-Overview
	-Rental Application Process
	-The Rental Application Form


Overview

As a community manager, you will normally be charged with accepting or rejecting prospective residents.  This is one of the most important functions that you will perform as a manager of a manufactured home community.  Done properly and effectively, the rental application and screening process will minimize potential problems in landlord – resident relations.  If the process is done incorrectly the seeds of future problems will be sown.  Every prospective resident should be given sufficient information to make an informed decision about living in a manufactured home community.  

When an individual stops by the manufactured home community office inquiring on the possibility of becoming a resident, always give them an application packet.  

Anyone who is interested in applying should be given the application packet – inconsistency in giving out application packets could lead to claims by the resident selling the home, or a fair housing violation. 

If yours is a family park, i.e. accepting all ages, avoid becoming engaged in discussions about the suitability of the community for children.  Questions such as “Is the park ‘child friendly’ or similar inquiries, are too subjective to answer. Responding to similar questions, either in person or on the phone, regarding other protected class, e.g. race, religion, national origin, sexual preference (in some Oregon cities), etc., should be avoided. Remember, Fair Housing “testers” could be asking in order to see if you answer differently at different times.  Simply inform prospective tenants that they may tour the park, speak with other residents, past and present, and make their own determination.

Include in the application packet an application and “Minimum Criteria Standards”, optional information may include what homes are available in the community, a community newsletter, information on the history of the community, the advantages of living in a manufactured home community etc.  NOTE: ORS 90.680(5) requires the following:

“If a landlord requires a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant under subsection (4) of this section, at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser an application the landlord shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale, all as provided by ORS 90.510. The terms of the statement, rental agreement and rules and regulations need not be the same as those in the selling tenant’s statement, rental agreement and rules and regulations.” (Emphasis added.)

ORS 90.680 covers the entire selling process. You should review the statute in its entirety.

Rental Application Process

The overall rental application process should include:

1.	Review application to make sure it has been completely filled out. If not completed, it should be promptly returned to the applicant.  Do not keep the application for several days and then return it to complete. Oregon law requires tenants give management not less than ten (10) days written notice before the sale of their home.  If the tenant does so, then management has seven (7) days within which to accept or reject an applicant who has submitted a fully completed application.  However, a longer period may be  agreed upon between the manager and the applicant. Your MHCO application form permits you and the applicant to agree upon a longer time. If the current tenant has not given management the 10-day advance written notice of sale, then the manager has ten (10) days to accept or reject. WARNING: The failure to timely accept or reject means that the prospective tenant will be accepted on the same terms as contained in the selling tenant’s rental agreement.  If you and an applicant agree upon an extension of time to process their paperwork, make sure that the agreement is in writing and signed.
2.	Check to make sure that the applicant has included a valid social security number, driver license information etc. NOTE: To avoid claims of discrimination based upon race, country of origin or ethnicity, you must be consistent with all applicants. If you insist upon one applicant having a valid social security number, you must require it of all.  Do not make exceptions.  Remember: Fair Housing testers will be watching for inconsistency.  
3.	Provide the applicant with a copy of the Statement of Policy (keep a signed copy or receipt for your file), the rent history of the space, Rental Agreement/Lease, Park Rules & Regulations, RV Storage Agreement and Pet Agreement (if applicable).  None of these are to be signed by you until they have been reviewed and accepted by you. The Statement of Policy statute is ORS 90.510. You should review it from time to time.
4.	Collect application fee.
5.	Provide prospective resident with application fee receipt.
6.	Conduct credit, rental and criminal check.
7.	Attach copies of credit, rental and criminal check to application.
8.	If credit, rental and criminal checks are acceptable contact prospective resident.
9.	If they are denied and they are purchasing an existing home in the park, send them an application denial form.  Also, send a copy to the resident selling the home and one for the tenant’s file. NOTE: Make sure your existing residents understand that you are not required to accept prospective residents until they have successfully completed the application process and have been approved for residency. 

The Rental Application Form

The Rental Application form provides the basic information needed to make a decision on accepting the applicant.  As noted above, unless a longer time has been agreed upon in writing, current Oregon Law gives you either (a) up to seven (7) days from receipt of the application to accept or reject (if the tenant-seller gave you the required advance ten (10) days’ notice of sale) or (b) up to ten (10) days (if the tenant-seller did not give you the 10-day notice). Used properly, the rental application and personal interview will prove helpful in countering charges of discrimination in renting spaces.  When completed, a rental application should reveal:

•	Financial information
•	Employment information
•	Residence history 
•	Household members
•	Social security number(s)
•	Driver license number(s)
•	Ownership or lien-holder of the unit 
•	Age, size and condition of the unit 
•	Information about motor vehicles 
•	Pets
•	Age verification if the community is classified as 55 or older or 62 or older housing
•	Credit references
•	Emergency contacts
•	Authorization to do credit and criminal checks 
•	Acknowledgement of receipt of disclosure documents

At the time the prospective tenant is given an application for residency, the manager or landlord must also provide the prospective tenant with copies of the Statement of Policy (with required exhibits), which includes the rent history of the space, the Rental Agreement and the Rules and Regulations and a map of the facility. 

Have a receipt form to give to all persons to whom you have provided a Statement of Policy. Make sure that you receive and retain all signed receipts, as they are proof of delivery of the Statement of Policy.  If the prospective resident is approved for occupancy, then put the signed receipt in their file together with their signed statement of policy.  Retain copies of ALL receipts of delivery in a separate file, including those confirming delivery of the Statements of Policy to persons who did not return their applications or whose applications were rejected. 

Take time to make sure the prospective resident is aware of the content of each of these documents.  It will do the community or the resident little good to have the prospective resident move in without taking the time to read and understand the Statement of Policy, the rent history of the space, the Rental Agreement and the Rules and Regulations.

<p>10.	A landlord may charge a tenant an amount for a violation of a written an amount for a violation of a written pet agreement or rules relating to pets not to exceed $50.00 for each violation.</p>
<p>There is almost no greater issue that can create problems for landlords, than whether tenants can retain a pet they have brought into the community. How can owners and managers take control of the issue?</p>
<p>First, landlords should check their current rules and rental agreement. Although landlords who have previously permitted pets in the community, cannot retroactively prohibit them to tenants who already have pets living with them. Nor can they retroactively prohibit a type of pet that had previously been permitted. However, going forward, i.e. for new tenants, landlords should make sure that their rules place appropriate limitations on the size and type of pets that can be brought into the park. Rules should be drafted broadly to prohibit pets, e.g. breeds of dogs, that have a reputation for aggressiveness, or dogs of a particular size, or both.</p>
<p>Secondly, consistency is important. That is, landlords should be careful not to make exceptions or ignore violations of the pet rules. Otherwise, the landlord will be accused of either being arbitrary or ""playing favorites."" Selective prosecution of tenants for violation of the pet rules does not play well with judges and juries.</p>
<p>Lastly, in all cases, landlords should make sure that their tenants sign pet agreements for their animals. Oregon law expressly permits this. The MHCO agreement (Form 21)  follows the statutory guidelines and assures that the tenant has liability insurance coverage. It also permits landlords to assess fines for violations of the rules.</p>","<p>One of the most challenging issues facing park owners and managers is the issue of pets.

BY
PHILLIP C. QUERIN, LEGAL COUNSEL MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITIES OF OREGON (“MHCO”)
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A manufactured housing community under Oregon law is one in which the resident owns and occupies the manufactured dwelling and rents the underlying space. If four or more such spaces are situated within 500 feet of each other1, it becomes subject to regulation under Oregon’s manufactured housing law, which is primarily found in ORS 90.505 et. seq.
Senate Bill 2942, which became law on June 23, 2011, was introduced by the Manufactured Housing Landlord/Tenant Coalition, which consists of community residents, park and marina owners, manufacturers, affordable housing nonprofits, submetering companies, and Oregon’s Manufactured Communities Resource Center.
Background. Historically, park owners recovered the cost of providing water [including wastewater and storm water] in one of following three ways:
o By including it in the base rent charged to all residents, aka the “base rent” method.
o By billing it to the residents separately from rent, based upon master meter readings. The calculation is normally arrived at by allocating the total charges on a per space basis, aka
the “prorata” method.
o By billing it to the residents separately from rent, based upon submeters placed on each
space.3
When water was cheap in years past, its cost was normally recovered in the landlord’s base rent. However, with rising costs and conservation concerns, both landlords and residents began to explore methods of monitoring usage, so that the cost could be spread among residents more equitably. The natural consequence of individual accountability for water usage was increased conservation, which benefited both landlords and residents – hence the growing trend toward submetering.
Senate Bill 929. In 2009, the Coalition submitted, and the Oregon Legislature passed SB 929, which required communities of 200+ spaces to convert to water submetering by December 31, 2012.4 Communities on well water were not permitted to separately charge residents based upon a master meter, i.e. “pro rata” method.5
1 ORS 446.003(23)
2 This bill dealt primarily with park submetering and conversion of parks into subdivisions. This White Paper deals only with submetering.
3 Since submeters only monitor water usage at the individual spaces, community common area usage is normally allocated to residents on a pro-rata basis from mater meter readings.
4 This mandatory requirement applied only to landlords using the master meter method where the cost was prorated among all residents. It did not apply to communities where the cost of water was included in the base rent.
5 ORS 90.532 (7)
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼©2011 QUERIN LAW, LLC
1
Senate Bill 294. With its passage on June 23, 2011, SB 294 now permits an exception to SB 929’s mandatory submetering requirement for 200+ space communities that use the master meter/pro rata billing method. It requires pro rata billing method sometimes referred to as “super conservation”.6 It is important to note that SB 294 does not eliminate the mandatory conversion to submeters for 200+ space communities if they are on the master meter/pro rata billing method and do not adopt the “super conservation” rules.
SB 294 now permits all landlords who install submeters, to impose a special assessment on residents to recover for the for the cost of installation.
DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SENATE BILL 294
o General Information:
 Mandatory submetering for communities of 200+ spaces only applies if they
currently use the master meter/pro rata billing method pursuant to ORS 90.532 (1)
(b) (C) (ii).
 Manufactured housing communities will no longer be permitted to convert from
the “base rent” method of water cost recovery to a pro rata method under ORS
90.532 (3).
 The December 31, 2012 deadline imposed for 200+ space communities by SB
929 is continued.
 For communities on well water:
 They may not convert from a base rent method of recovery to a prorata method; and
 They are specifically exempted from mandatory submetering, regardless of the number of spaces.
o Super Conservation Rules [For communities using the master meter recovery method. Effective after December 31, 2012]:
 They must bill for water using the pro rata billing method by apportioning the utility provider’s charge to residents on a pro rata basis, with only the following factors being considered:
 The number of residents or occupants in the manufactured dwelling compared with the number of residents or occupants in the manufactured dwelling park [basing two-thirds (2/3) of the charge to the residents on this factor]; and
 The size of a resident’s space as a percentage of the total area of the manufactured dwelling park [basing one-third (1/3) of the charge on this factor].
 The number of residents and/or occupants in each dwelling unit and in the community must be determined at least annually. 7

 Requires adoption of other conservation measures:
 Annual testing of pipes and appliance for leaks at no charge to residents;
results are to be made available to them; applies to common areas as well.
 Residents are required to permit access under ORS 90.725, if necessary
for landlord to conduct test.
 Landlord is required to repair any significant leaks in common areas.
 Landlord may require that residents repair any significant leaks found
inside their dwellings within a “reasonable time”.8
 Landlord are required to repair leaks in pipes located on resident’s space
that connect to the dwelling.9
 Resident’s failure to repair a significant leak after request may be evicted
following two written notices - one to make the repair and the other to
comply with the notice of termination provisions of ORS 90.630.10
 A resident adversely affected by a landlord’s noncompliance with the mandatory submetering law [or the super conservation exceptions] may sue to enforce
compliance and recover damages.
o Caveats11:
 Super conservation only applies to landlords covered by SB 929, i.e. 200+ space
communities using the master meter/prorata billing method.
 Small communities under 200 spaces may not test a resident’s dwelling unit for
water leaks.
 Super conservation methods do not apply to marinas.
 Although these provisions deal with billing residents for water usage, since most
municipalities charge for wastewater and storm water based upon water usage, SB
294 applies to these charges as well.
 ORS 90.510 (4) (b) governs the landlord’s right to unilaterally amend a rental
agreement [i.e. without resident consent]. This statute is amended by SB 294 to expressly permit landlords to convert to the super conservation pro rata billing method via unilateral amendment of the residents’ rental agreement.

￼more, on the assumption that more occupants consume more water, and on the additional assumption that those tenants with larger spaces are likely to use more water for watering lawns or plants. This is not as fair as individual submeters, but it is fairer than everyone paying the same no matter what. The proportion-of-residents-in-the- dwelling concept already exists as an allowable billing method in ORS 90.534 (2) (c) (B).”
8 Note: This follows the same approach as found in the repair and deterioration statute, ORS 90.632(7), which specifically itemizes timing considerations such as weather and other conditions outside of a resident’s control.
9 Note: This is an obligation that did not previously exist in the pre-SB 294 version of ORS 90.730, which describes landlord obligations to residents.
10JVL Legislative History: “This could be a harsh result, but the alternative is allowing water to be wasted, driving up costs for everyone in the park, not just the tenant with the leak.”]
11 JVL Legislative History: “The coalition views the significant changes in existing law here -- regarding leaks and testing, for example -- as an experiment, limited to the SB 929 parks; the coalition will monitor how this experiment works, for possible future tweaking or expansion.”

o Changes to ORS 90.532 [Billing methods for utility or service charges; system maintenance; restriction on charging for water]
 Allows pro rata billing for water for new residents if the rest of the park is already using pro rata billing. 12
 Note: New prorata billing arrangements have been continuously prohibited since 2009 by SB 772, even with mutual landlord-resident agreement.
 Applies to new rental agreements and mutually amended rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010.
 New communities, or those expanding over 200 spaces, may only use submetering for water.
 Allows landlords to use electronic mail [“e-mail”] to bill residents monthly for any utility or service charges that are billed separate from rent if permitted by the rental agreement. [Note: Landlord may not unilaterally amend rental agreement to do so. It must be consensual.]
o Changes to ORS 90.536 [Charges for utilities or services measured by submeter]13
 Corrects an error in current law that permitted billing for stormwater based upon water use as measured by a submeter. However, only wastewater is normally
billed by utility companies in this manner.14 Now, the landlord may only bill for:
 The cost of any sewer service for wastewater as a percentage of the resident’s water charge as measured by a submeter, if the utility or service provider charges the landlord for sewer service as a percentage of water
provided; or,
 A pro rata portion of the cost of sewer service for storm water and
wastewater if the utility or service provider does not charge the landlord
for sewer service as a percentage of water provided.
 Permits landlords to add a pro rata charge for common areas.
 Landlords will be allowed to include the cost of a third party billing service for
reading the meters and handling the billing process. [Note: This is limited to water submetering and super conservation billing methods only.]
o Changes to ORS 90.537 [Conversion of billing method for utility or service charges]15
 The amount of base rent reduction required upon submeter conversion may not be less than an amount reasonably comparable to the amount of the rent previously allocated to the utility or service cost averaged over at least the preceding one year. [Previously, it was six months.]
 Previously, landlords were prohibited from directly assessing residents for the

13 See, ORS 90.534 for charges based upon the pro rata billing method.
14 Note: ORS 90.315 was changed to distinguish between stormwater and wastewater in order to be consistent with the 2011 changes to ORS 90.536.

cost of submeter installation. This has now been changed.16
 As an option only, a landlord may levy an assessment for actual post-
installation [not anticipated pre-installation] cost, with resident repayment spread over not less than 60 months - to be included with the utility or service charge.17 The installation cost may include related capital costs, e.g. upgrading water lines required to handle higher water pressure.
 Note: This right of assessment is limited to manufactured housing communities, not marinas; it may be any size park; and it can be used for any utility installation, not only water.
 Miscellaneous:
 Landlords converting to submeters may unilaterally switch to the pro rata
billing method for common areas. [However, this change should be
included in the landlord’s initial 180-day notice of intent to submeter.]
 If the landlord continues to recover water charges for common areas from base rent, he/she may offset against the rent reduction an amount reflecting the cost of serving the common areas. If the utility or service provider cannot provide the landlord with an accurate cost for the service to the common areas, the landlord “...shall assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed.” [Note: This offset is not available if the landlord chooses to bill for the common area water using the pro rata method.]
o Changes to ORS 90.730 [Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition]
 Expands the habitability requirements for common areas as follows: “If supplied or required to be supplied by the landlord to a common area, a water supply system, sewage disposal system or system for disposing of storm water, ground water and subsurface water approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the system can be controlled by the landlord.”
o Changes to ORS 446.062 [Rules regulating parks; state building code requirements; approval for new construction or additional lots]
 For anticipated cost savings, allows for installation of community submeters to be treated as “...a minor plumbing installation*** performed under a statewide permit and inspection system for minor construction work....”
16 JVL Legislative History: “This change reflects our new understanding that submeter installation may be significantly more expensive ($250 to $800 per meter) than we thought in 2005 ($50 per meter). At an average installation cost of $500, the cost to install submeters in a 200 space park would be $100,000. Given current problems securing private market financing for anything, and the lack of any public financing, the coalition worried about how landlords would pay for installation. Landlords could, of course, raise the rent to cover the cost (though current law requires a six month waiting period), but tenants generally fear that rent increases never go down -- meaning that a landlord who raised the rent to cover the cost of submeter installation would not lower the rent after the installation was paid for. And current law prohibits including the cost of installation in a utility or service charge; ORS 90.536 (3).”
17 Query: May the cost recovery be carried over to a new resident if the existing resident sells and/or removes the home? In fairness, it would seem so.

"333","333","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Additional Government Fees ","Question. The City of Gresham is now charging a “Public Safety Fee” on every mobile home space in the city.  It starts at $2.40/month/space and escalates to $7.19/month/space in June.  Park owners have to pay the fee for all residents and then try to collect it back from them.  If the residents have their own utility accounts with the City, they pay their fee directly, but most parks pay water and sewer utilities in bulk.

What can you tell me about this Public Safety Fee, and whether I can treat it as a utility or service, and pass it through to park residents?

Answer.  First, one caveat:  This Answer is not intended to constitute legal advice.  It is educational only, and should not be relied upon by an MHCO member in lieu of consulting their own legal counsel, who is familiar with their own specific factual situation.

Let’s start with a definition of a “utility” under Oregon’s Residential Landlord Tenant Act.  Like all legislation coming out of Salem, there is no easy answer.  The statute is found at ORS 90.315.  I will try to summarize the relevant portions for purposes of this Answer:  

Oregon Law.  90.315 Utility or service payments; additional charges; responsibility for utility or service; remedies.  
•	A “Utility or service” includes but is not limited to electricity, natural or liquid propane gas, oil, water, hot water, heat, air conditioning, cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services, Internet access or usage, sewer service and garbage collection and disposal. [Italics mine. PCQ]
•	A landlord must disclose to the tenant in writing at or before the commencement of the tenancy any utility or service that the tenant pays directly to a utility or service provider that benefits, directly, the landlord or other tenants. A tenant’s payment for a given utility or service benefits the landlord or other tenants if the utility or service is delivered to any area other than the tenant’s dwelling unit. [Italics mine.]
o	If a landlord knowingly fails to disclose such payments, the tenant may recover twice the actual damages sustained or one month’s rent, whichever is greater.
•	A utility or service charge may only include the cost of the utility or service as billed to the landlord by the provider. 
o	A landlord may add an additional amount to a utility or service charge billed to the tenant if:
•	The utility or service charge to which the additional amount is added is for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage; 
•	The additional amount is not more than 10 percent of the utility or service charge billed to the tenant;
•	The total of the utility or service charge and the additional amount is less than the typical periodic cost the tenant would incur if the tenant contracted directly with the provider for the cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;
•	The written rental agreement must describe the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge; and
•	Any billing or notice from the landlord regarding the utility or service charge lists the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge.
•	A landlord may not require a tenant to agree to the amendment of an existing rental agreement, and may not terminate a tenant for refusing to agree to the amendment of a rental agreement, if the amendment would obligate the tenant to pay an additional amount for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage.
•	A utility or service charge, including any additional amounts added pursuant to the provisions immediately above, is not rent or a fee. 
•	Nonpayment of a utility or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause.
•	If a landlord fails to comply with the paragraphs above regarding disclosure of the additional charges, the tenant may recover from the landlord an amount equal to one month’s periodic rent or twice the amount wrongfully charged to the tenant, whichever is greater.

Without getting into a detailed discussion of the pass-through laws contained in ORS 90.531 – 90.530, suffice it to say that subject to several limitations, park landlords are permitted to pass through utility and service charges to their tenants. So assuming that the landlord’s pass-through program was legally implemented and is legally described in the written rental agreement, the issue is whether the City of Gresham’s “Public Safety Fee” constitutes a “utility or service,” as described in ORS 90.315(1)(b), which provides that it includes but is not limited to:
“…electricity, natural or liquid propane gas, oil, water, hot water, heat, air conditioning, cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services, Internet access or usage, sewer service and garbage collection and disposal.”  

Clearly, the statute, by its own terms, says that a “utility or service” can include more than what is described above. Unfortunately, it gives no guidance as to what that might be. A quick online check of Oregon definitions, seem to presuppose a “public utility”; e.g. sewer, water and electricity.  How, the definition of “utility” is much more generic, i.e. “something useful.”  Moreover, we can see from the examples given in the ORS 90.315(1)(b), that several are not publicly owned.   And the word “service” is so open-ended as to defy a specific definition, other than “something provided.”

Accordingly, the definition of a “utility or service” is not rigidly defined by ORS 90.315, and, depending on the circumstances, can include charges for “useful things or services” imposed by a government body, even though they were not specifically enumerated in ORS 90.315(1)(b).

City of Gresham’s Explanation. Now let’s look at the City of Gresham; how do they describe it and what is it intended to do?  On its website explaining the fee, the City goes to great lengths to call it “temporary.”  It is a single line-item that is added to customers’ water bills. It appears under the heading “Residential Utility Charges.”

The Gresham website explanation of the fee is the following: “The temporary Police, Fire and Parks Fee *** goes into effect Feb. 1 for single-family households, multifamily property owners and businesses to help maintain essential police positions and keep our fire stations open. The per-unit fee was shaped by a public input process in 2012 and includes a phase-in for multifamily properties.”

The website’s FAQs add the following points: 
•	95% of the fee proceeds will be used to support public safety services. The remaining five percent will go toward Parks.
•	Whether or not the fee will be passed on to a tenant will be determined by the lease or rental agreement.
•	Financial assistance is available to those who qualify. A rental assistance program has been created to help low-income families and individuals pay the fee. Contact Human Solutions at 503-548-0200. The City offers an assistance program that provides emergency funds to help qualified utility customers that are experiencing financial hardship. Apply for the utility bill assistance program at 503-618-2373. Non-profit housing providers who own and operate multifamily properties that are restricted as low-income housing by a recorded regulatory agreement or by the Office of Housing and Urban Development may be eligible for assistance. For more information contact Rachael Fuller at 503-618-2255 or Rachael.Fuller@GreshamOregon.gov.
•	Owners of multifamily properties will be charged the fee per unit in the building.  However, those with more than three units have been granted a gradual phase-in period. These property owners will pay: A 4.1% vacancy discount will be applied to the fee for all multifamily development. Multi-family property owners will pay:
o	$2.50 per unit for February-March
o	$5 per unit for April-May
o	$7.50 per unit from June 2013-June 2014
Conclusion.   I have not conducted an in-depth evaluation of this issue or the law.  Subject to that limitation, it appears to me that a good argument can be made that the Public Safety Fee is either a utility or a fee, and as such, may be properly passed through to community residents.  And since it is a prorated flat fee, it cannot be said to benefit other tenants or the landlord.   
If and when passed through, it should certainly be explained to the residents, and appear as a separate line item on their invoice.

There is almost no greater issue that can create problems for landlords, than whether tenants can retain a pet they have brought into the community. How can owners and managers take control of the issue?

First, landlords should check their current rules and rental agreement. Although landlords who have previously permitted pets in the community, cannot retroactively prohibit them to tenants who already have pets living with them. Nor can they retroactively prohibit a type of pet that had previously been permitted. However, going forward, i.e. for new tenants, landlords should make sure that their rules place appropriate limitations on the size and type of pets that can be brought into the park. Rules should be drafted broadly to prohibit pets, e.g. breeds of dogs, that have a reputation for aggressiveness, or dogs of a particular size, or both.

Secondly, consistency is important. That is, landlords should be careful not to make exceptions or ignore violations of the pet rules. Otherwise, the landlord will be accused of either being arbitrary or ""playing favorites."" Selective prosecution of tenants for violation of the pet rules does not play well with judges and juries.

Lastly, in all cases, landlords should make sure that their tenants sign pet agreements for their animals. Oregon law expressly permits this. The MHCO agreement (Form 21) follows the statutory guidelines and assures that the tenant has liability insurance coverage. It also permits landlords to assess fines for violations of the rules.","One of the most challenging issues facing park owners and managers is the issue of pets.

"239","239","3","55 and Older Communities and Marketing","People are now living long after retirement. According to the 2007 period life table for the Social Security area population, those on the cusp of retirement, ages 55‐64, are expected to live on average 21.34 more years. Living in a manufactured home community represents an ideal lifestyle choice for many in this demographic. The following represents some real advantages that manufactured homes offer the 55+ market:

‐ Manufactured homes can be customized to fit the needs and wants of every homebuyer. This includes interior floor plans, exterior designs and custom kitchens, baths and living areas.
‐ Manufactured housing, especially those located in land‐lease communities, are less expensive to purchase and maintain.
‐ Manufactured homes offer convenient one‐story living and can be built for accessibility.
‐ Manufactured home communities provide a unique setting where smaller yards require less maintenance, while individual home sites maximize privacy.
‐ Manufactured home communities provide a secure, friendly, relaxed environment with a strong sense of ‘community’.

How can manufactured housing communities benefit 55+?

Manufactured housing communities allow residents to own their own home while leasing the land, thus eliminating the expense of property taxes and allowing homeowners to enjoy amenities and well‐maintained common areas. According to a report prepared for the Commission of Affordable Housing and Health Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st Century, advantages of land‐lease properties are that “the resident can own the home with a lower down‐payment than virtually any
other housing alternative because the cost of land is not included in the transaction. The resident can also benefit from appreciation, provided the home is well maintained in a well‐ located and maintained park.”

In addition, and no less important, is the sense of community engendered by the manufactured home lifestyle. By providing many opportunities for social interaction through organized activities, such as clubs, fitness classes and social events, communities encourage resident relationships. Safety and security are top concerns for many residents. Many 55+ communities are gated and provide on‐site security as well as neighborhood watch programs. By providing a sense of security, spaces to personalize, interesting destinations and places to walk, and the options of having pets, manufactured home communities have the potential of
encouraging active living for 55+ individuals.

What can community owners offer to attract the 55+ market?

Age restricted manufactured housing communities, typically called 55+, offer many advantages with many different types of land‐lease communities to choose from. They can be large communities with numerous amenities or smaller and more affordable family‐owned communities. There are communities located all over the country and in every price range. Common amenities include swimming pools, clubhouses, health clubs, and tennis courts.

We know that most people begin their housing search online. To capture the attention of those looking online at housing options, 55+ manufactured home communities need to have attractive websites that provide lots of information, including pictures of the community (not just individual homes), information about lease fees, and testimonials from homeowners. In addition, an attractive and informative website should highlight those services and amenities that are important and attractive to seniors. Jensen Communities (www.jensencommunities.com), offers a great example of a website that is user‐friendly. In addition to outlining important information related to the advantages of living in a manufactured home, the website provides prospective residents with a comprehensive list of special amenities found in their communities.
Jim Ayotte, Executive Director of the Florida Manufactured Housing Association, states, “to make an emotional connection with prospective homebuyers, every community’s website should have a detailed description of their value proposition, with quality pictures of homes and individuals. Homeowner testimonials are a great idea.” With over 900 55+ manufactured home communities, Florida represents a top destination choice for many. In Mr. Ayotte’s view, the range of options available in Florida’s 55+ communities is limitless. Those in the 55+ market are undoubtedly attracted to Florida’s warm climate, sandy beaches, suburban or rural settings (depending on preferences), excellent health care and affordable cost of living. Many of Florida’s 55+ manufactured housing communities have swimming pools, community centers, health clubs, tennis courts and executive or professional golf courses. Seniors are looking not just to buy a home but to buy into a lifestyle. Ayotte also explained that he expects the 55+ community industry to expand over the next ten years as the baby‐boomer generation reaches retirement age. 

Experts have indicated that baby‐boomers are very active and many are expected to continue working after they retire. Community owners that focus on the 55+ market need to be poised to meet the unique needs of this large demographic.

Manufactured home communities continue to be a popular option for a growing segment of the aging U.S. baby boomer generation. In the last decade, the median age of the nation has increased from 35.3 to 37.2 – an all‐time high as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2010, 17.3 percent of Florida’s population was age 65 or higher. This trend is expected to continue as more seniors flock to Florida and other warm weather retirement destinations. For seniors, 55+ manufactured home communities provide an affordable housing choice with great lifestyle advantages. Clearly, this niche market is a great opportunity for seniors and community owners alike.

"240","240","3","55 + Older Communities and Discrimination Against Children","<p><strong>Question One</strong>:   If a community is a legal 55+ park, is it still subject to the federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination against children?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Generally, no. However, this isn’t a license to be rude to them.  Let’s start with the basics:  If you are a legal 55+ community, you are not required to admit as residents, persons with children, i.e. those under the age of 18.  If there are children in the community (perhaps before the facility converted to 55+, or simply because less than 20% of all spaces are occupied by persons with children), the park may do things that it could not do if it was a family park, such as prohibit children’s Big Wheels and bicycles in the street.  Generally, however, the best approach is to strive for 100% compliance with the 55+ laws in terms of occupancy.  If you want to be a “safe” 55+ community, you will have rules that expressly say so; a rental/lease agreement that expressly says so; application and tenant home sale provisions that limit spaces to at least one occupant 55+; and generally hold yourself out in all advertising as a 55+ community.  Of course, seniors are permitted to bring children (e.g. grandchildren, etc.) into the community, but the rules may place limits on the amount of time they may remain there.</p>
<p><strong>Question Two:</strong> If the current rules in a family community appear to be discriminatory towards children – e.g. they place restrictions that have a discriminatory impact on children or persons with children (e.g. curfew on children, even if it’s intended to be for their own safety) can the landlord unilaterally amend the rules, or does he/she need to go through the formal rule change process outlined in the ORS 90.610?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You need to go through the formal rule change process described in the statute.  A rule that is not legally enacted, isn’t really an enforceable rule.  However, you should immediately issue a written notice to all residents that based upon legal advice, those rules (identifying them) that appear to be discriminatory against children, will not be enforced.  If you own a family park and are concerned that your rules may appear to “target” children, you should consult with your attorney for advice on how to proceed.  Note that even if your rules don’t appear to target children, if they, in fact, affect the activities of children more heavily than adults, they could still be deemed to be discriminatory (e.g. occupancy limits).  And if you are a family park, but you have over 80% of the spaces occupied by at least one person age 55 or over, you should ask your attorney about “converting” to become a legal 55+ community.  Until you do, even though 99% of the community’s spaces are occupied by seniors, you’re still a family park, and subject to the anti-discrimination laws protecting children.</p>","<p><strong>Question One</strong>:   If a community is a legal 55+ park, is it still subject to the federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination against children?</p>",,"1331580144","2"

<p><strong>E-mail: kmonte@bhcapitalgroup.com</strong></p>
<p>The SAFE Act has received a lot of attention lately by park owners, but did you know that it’s really only one law of many state and federal lending regulations you are required to comply with when selling homes on contract?</p>
<p>The SAFE Act requires you, the park owner, to either use a licensed Mortgage Loan Originator such as Blackhawk Capital Group or obtain your own origination licensing in order to sell your park homes on installment contracts. However, the greater issue is that obtaining those licenses for most companies is really a small step towards being fully compliant when acting as a creditor.  Below are just a few of the other regulations that you need to follow as a creditor.</p>
<p><strong>1)	The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DFA)</strong> established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent entity housed within the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). The newly created CFPB is the primary regulator for non-depository lenders with the broad authority to write rules to protect consumers, a.k.a. “borrowers”, from unfair or deceptive financial products, acts or practices. The CFPB will be collecting, investigating and responding to borrower complaints which can be easily submitted from the comfort of a resident’s home via the CFPB’s website.</p>
<p>The CFPB will be in charge of the major consumer protection laws including RESPA, TILA, HOEPA, HMDA, SAFE, Fair Credit, Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act; Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act; Inspector General Act; Privacy Act; Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act (AMTPA); Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA); Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA); Expedited Funds Availability Act; Fair Credit Billing Act; Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA); Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA); Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act; Federal Trade Commission Act; Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLB) and more.</p>
<p>This would naturally imply that if you’re investigated because of a consumer’s complaint stemming from a denial of credit or foreclosure, the CFPB could easily extend the investigation to include an examination of all your lending practices.</p>
<p><strong>2)	The Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act (MDIA)</strong> requires creditors to wait 7 business days after the delivery of the initial Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement before you can close the loan. In addition, if the APR changes by more than a specified tolerance from initial disclosure you’ll need to allow the borrower 3 additional business days.  However, waiting periods can be shortened or waived if the extension of credit is necessary to meet a personal financial emergency. To shorten the waiver period, borrowers must prepare a signed and dated written statement, signed by all borrowers involved, detailing the specific emergency and requesting a waiver of the waiting period.</p>
<p><strong>3)	The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) </strong>places disclosure obligations on users of consumer reports and to ensure fair, timely, and accurate reporting of credit information. This means that you are required to notify the borrower when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports, such as if you deny someone a loan or offer them a smaller loan than what they applied for. In addition, you must identify the company that provided the report, so that the accuracy and completeness of the report may be verified or contested by the borrower. We recommend that you provide separate notices to each borrower to protect yourself from violating their privacy. There are additional criteria for those of you that furnish information to credit agencies that will land on a borrower’s credit report.</p>
<p><strong>4)	The Truth in Lending Act (TILA)</strong> applies to each individual or business that offers or extends credit more than 5 times for transactions secured by a dwelling in the preceding calendar year. There are many applicable areas within TILA depending on how your loans are structured so we’ll discuss the act in a few general areas only.</p>
<p>•	TILA limits the amount of fees that can be charged on certain transactions without additional requirements and it limits when those fees can be charged for all transactions.</p>
<p>•	TILA mandates early disclosure of a creditor’s identity, amount financed, itemization of amount financed, APR, finance charges, total of payments, payment schedule, prepayment penalties and late payment fees.</p>
<p>•	Creditors are liable for violation of the disclosure requirements, regardless of whether the borrower was harmed by the nondisclosure.</p>
<p><strong>5)	Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)</strong> prohibits discrimination of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance. Park owners may consider a borrower’s immigration status in order to ensure the borrower will be in the country long enough to repay the loan. You may not ask borrowers if they receive child support or alimony payments unless you notify them that they need only to provide this information if it will be used in determining their ability to repay. We encourage park owners to create written loan guidelines with clear underwriting standards to avoid violating fair credit laws. If you make an exception to your loan guidelines, be sure to properly document the reason for the exception and add it to the borrower’s file.</p>
<p><strong>6)	The Red Flags Rule</strong> requires creditors to implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect the warning signs of identity theft. There are four major components necessary to be compliant with the Red Flags Rule.</p>
<p>•	First - be able to identify patterns, practices, and activity that signal identity theft.</p>
<p>•	Second - incorporate business practices that will detect identity theft, “Red Flags”. Park owners using our loan processing service can rest assured knowing all borrowers are run through a red flag checklist which is provided after the completion of our underwriting process.</p>
<p>•	Third - detailed response for any red flags detected by red flags.</p>
<p>•	Fourth - your program must be updated periodically to reflect any changes or additional information you’ve discovered that will help reduce identity theft.</p>
<p>As you may have heard, Blackhawk Capital Group has developed a comprehensive, customizable loan processing solution to meet the needs of manufactured housing community professionals selling homes on retail installment contracts.  Our goal is to provide you with a full compliance solution so that you can continue doing what you do best without having to learn all of the lending laws.  You continue to be the lender and after the loan closes, you also continue to service your own notes. We simply facilitate the part of the transaction that requires a licensed mortgage loan originator.  We facilitate the delivery of every form and disclosure that you will need to ensure you are compliant with the lending laws in your state.  Currently, we are providing loan processing services in 11 states including Oregon, Washington, California, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Colorado, Maryland and New Mexico.</p>

Answer:  Here is a summary of ORS 90.260, the late fee statute.  

(1)	 A landlord may impose a late charge or fee, however designated, only if:
•	The rent payment is not received by the fourth day of the period for which rent is payable; and
•	There exists a written rental agreement that specifies:
o	The tenant’s obligation to pay a late charge;
o	The type and amount of the late charge; and
o	The date on which rent payments are due, and the date on which late charges become due.

(2)	The amount of any late charge may not exceed:
•	A reasonable flat amount, charged once per rental period. “Reasonable amount” means the customary amount charged by landlords for that rental market;
•	A reasonable amount, charged on a per-day basis, beginning on the fifth day of the rental period for which rent is delinquent. This daily charge may accrue every day thereafter until the rent (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only. The per-day charge may not exceed six percent of the amount of the “reasonable flat amount”, described above; or
•	Five percent of the periodic rent payment amount, charged once for each succeeding five-day period, or portion thereof, for which the rent payment is delinquent, beginning on the fifth day of that rental period and continuing until that rent payment (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only.

(3)	In periodic tenancies [e.g. month-to-month], a landlord may change the type or amount of late charge by giving 30 days’ written notice to the tenant.

(4)	A landlord may not deduct a previously imposed late charge from a current or subsequent rental period rent payment in order to make the rent payment short so as to issue a 72-hour notice of nonpayment.

(5)	A landlord may charge simple interest on an unpaid late charge at the rate allowed for judgments (9.00%) and accruing from the date the late charge is imposed.

(6)	Nonpayment of a late charge alone is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause by using a curable 30-day written notice of termination.  [Note: The landlord may identify the late charge on the 72-hour notice of nonpayment of rent, so long as it makes clear that the tenant may cure the nonpayment notice by paying only the delinquent rent, not including any late charge.]

The dealer then sold the home to another person who applied for tenancy and passed the screening criteria.  The landlord wants the past due rent ($900) paid before permitting applicant to move into the home.  Can the landlord go after the dealer to pay the past due rent?  Can the landlord keep the applicant from moving in until the $900 is paid?  Should the landlord have given some notice to the existing tenant, the dealer, and/or the prospective tenant, regarding how the unpaid rent should be handled?  What about other expenses the tenant who sold the home ran up, such as utilities, late fees, maintenance clean up expenses, etc.?  What do you suggest as far as notices to the dealer stating the amount of money owed?  The dealer is not the lien holder.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Landlords should become intimately familiar with ORS 90.680, and then make sure their rules and rental agreements conform to what is allowed.  Set forth below is a summary of those portions of the statute that address your questions:</p>
<p>•	If the prospective purchaser of a manufactured dwelling or floating home desires to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, the landlord may require the following:</p>
<p>o	That a tenant give not more than 10 days’ notice in writing prior to the sale of the dwelling or home on a rented space;</p>
<p>o	That prior to the sale, the prospective purchaser submit to the landlord a complete and accurate written application for occupancy of the dwelling or home as a tenant after the sale is finalized;</p>
<p>o	That a prospective purchaser may not occupy the dwelling or home until after the prospective purchaser is accepted by the landlord as a tenant;</p>
<p>o	That a tenant give notice to any lienholder, prospective purchaser or person licensed to sell dwellings or homes of the requirements of the resale requirements [Emphasis mine – PCQ];</p>
<p>o	If the sale is not by a lienholder, that the prospective purchaser pay in full all rents, fees, deposits or charges owed by the tenant prior to the landlord’s acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a tenant [Emphasis mine];</p>
<p>•	If the landlord’s rules and/or rental agreement requires prospective purchasers to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant, at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser an application the landlord shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale ;</p>
<p>•	The following conditions apply if a landlord receives an application for tenancy from a prospective purchaser:</p>
<p>o	 The landlord shall accept or reject the prospective purchaser’s application within seven days following the day the landlord receives a complete and accurate written application ;</p>
<p>o	An application is not complete until the prospective purchaser pays any required applicant screening charge and provides the landlord with all information and documentation, including any financial data and references, required by the landlord;</p>
<p>•	The landlord may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant. Reasonable cause for rejection includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>o	Failure of the prospective purchaser to meet the landlord’s conditions for approval;</p>
<p>o	Failure of the prospective purchaser’s references to respond to the landlord’s timely request for verification within the time allowed for acceptance or rejection;</p>
<p>o	In most cases, the landlord must furnish to the seller and purchaser a written statement of the reasons for any rejection ;</p>
<p>•	The landlord may give the tenant selling the home a notice to repair the home [e.g. for damage or deterioration] under ORS 90.632. The landlord may also give any prospective purchaser a copy of that notice.</p>
<p>o	The landlord may require as a condition of tenancy that a prospective purchaser who desires to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant must comply with the repair notice within the allowed period under ORS 90.632.</p>
<p>o	If the tenancy has been terminated for failure to timely complete the repairs under ORS 90.632, a prospective purchaser does not have a right to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant.</p>
<p>Obviously, the statute was drafted with tenant/purchasers in mind.  However, as long as the home remains on the space, the landlord has complete control over the situation.  In your case, I suspect the delinquent tenant made no effort to notify the landlord of his planned sale to the dealer.  However, that does not prevent him from imposing these requirements on the dealer if he wants to put a tenant in the park.</p>
<p>Going forward, it might be advisable for all landlords who have faced this situation before, to prepare a summary of requirements to give dealers when they purchase homes from tenants already sited in the park.  They may want to expressly address this in their rules, so tenants cannot say they didn’t know.  The written summary to dealers should clearly state that if a departing tenant owes monies to the landlord, repayment will be required before occupancy of the home will be permitted by a new resident.  [<em>A more difficult question that is not addressed by the statute, ORS 90.680, is whether the landlord may prevent the dealer from removing the home without paying the past due sums.  I suspect the answer may be “Yes” a landlord may do so, but it would require my examination of the statutory storage or retaining lien rights, which is beyond the scope of this question. – PCQ]</em></p>","<p><strong>Question:</strong> A home was purchased by a local dealer from a resident who had not paid rent for several months.

"246","246","3","Phil Querin Q&A   Temporary Occupants  and Implications for  Rules and Regulations Screening  and Eviction","<p><strong>Question:</strong> The law and MHCO ocupancy agreement both state that a landlord can screen an occupant for conduct or criminal history but not for credit history or income level.  If after screening a temporary occupant, the findings reveal that they have civil case(s) and/or eviction matters relating to previous rental history where the derogatory rental reference is financial (not necessarily bad personal conduct).  Can this be grounds for denial?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Not in my opinion.  The temporary occupant agreement concept is that the person is not going to be a “co-renter”. They are being permitted to come onto the space as an accommodation by the landlord to the current resident who wants them there.  If they are to become a temporary occupant, but your background check inadvertently reveals derogatory references related to financial information, and that concerns you, then limit the amount of time they can remain there, and take things a month, or six months, at a time.  You might consider having tenants fill out a form in advance explaining exactly why they want the temporary occupant there.  If a tenant wants them there to share the rental obligation then you should know that before offering the temporary occupant status.  If that is the case, then have them apply as a tenant.  If they don’t pass the financial background check, then reject them on that basis.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> The temporary occupancy agreement states that the temporary occupant must comply with the laws/Rules Regulations &amp; Policies of the community.  Who is responsible to provide this information to the temporary occupant and when should it be given?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I understand that the temporary occupant law does not specifically address this point.  But you have the most to lose if the rules are not given to them at the outset of the temporary occupant relationship.  That being the case, I would suggest you append the rules to the temporary occupant agreement, and have them sign both the agreement and the attached rules.  Then there is no question about whether they got them.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> The temporary occupant agreement and the law state that a temporary occupant can be terminated “for cause” if there is a material violation of the occupancy agreement and that the temporary occupant does not have a right to cure the violation.  The other option is termination by automatic expiration of the agreement (if the box is checked that specifies this).  If the landlord needs to issue a for cause termination (instead of termination by automatic expiration) the termination must be done in accordance with the law outlined in ORS 90.392 (for non-MHP tenancies) or 90.630 (for MHP tenancies).  However after reading these statutes, they do not give an option for the landlord to issue a for cause notice with no right to cure. How is a landlord supposed to issue a for cause termination notice with no right to cure and have it held up in court?  If a landlord issues a for cause notice with no right to cure, what form should be used and what is the time frame for the termination?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The temporary occupant law is addressed in ORS 90.275. You may terminate the temporary occupant for a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement.  That agreement also terminates by its own terms when it expires (if you checked that box on the form). The law says that upon termination or expiration, the temporary occupant shall “promptly vacate.”  If they don’t, then the landlord can issue a for cause termination under 90.630 (for MHP tenancies) to the tenant – not the temporary occupant.  That means you would issue a termination notice under 90.630 for the tenant to vacate if the temporary occupant failed to do so as required.  The opportunity to cure is for the tenant to get the temporary occupant to vacate.    If they temporary occupant fails to vacate within the 30-day cure period given by law to the tenant, then the entire space tenancy is terminated.  In such case, the law says the temporary occupant – if they remain – is treated as a “squatter.”  ORS 90.403 then permits you to give a 24-hour non-curable termination notice to the “squatter”  and evict, if necessary, through the normal FED process.</p>","<p><strong>Question:</strong> The law and MHCO ocupancy agreement both state that a landlord can screen an occupant for conduct or criminal history but not for credit history or income level.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a new one.  The Oregon landlord tenant law does not expressly address this specific issue.  The closest it comes are the following laws:</p>
<p>1.	ORS 90.755 Right to speak on political issues; limitations; placement of political signs:</p>

The landlord of a facility, however, may enforce reasonable rules and regulations relating to the time, place and scheduling of the speakers that will protect the interests of the majority of the homeowners.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(2) The landlord shall allow the tenant to place political signs on or in a manufactured dwelling or floating home owned by the tenant or the space rented by the tenant. The size of the signs and the length of time for which the signs may be displayed are subject to the reasonable rules of the landlord. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>2.	90.750 Right to assemble or canvass in facility; limitations. No provision contained in any bylaw, rental agreement, regulation or rule pertaining to a facility shall:</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(1) Infringe upon the right of persons who rent spaces in a facility to peaceably assemble in an open public meeting for any lawful purpose, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, in the common areas or recreational areas of the facility. Reasonable times shall include daily the hours between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(2) Infringe upon the right of persons who rent spaces in a facility to communicate or assemble among themselves, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, for the purpose of discussing any matter, including but not limited to any matter relating to the facility or manufactured dwelling or floating home living. The discussions may be held in the common areas or recreational areas of the facility, including halls or centers, or any resident’s dwelling unit or floating home. The landlord of a facility, however, may enforce reasonable rules and regulations including but not limited to place, scheduling, occupancy densities and utilities.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(3) Prohibit any person who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home from canvassing other persons in the same facility for purposes described in this section. As used in this subsection, “canvassing” includes door-to-door contact, an oral or written request, the distribution, the circulation, the posting or the publication of a notice or newsletter or a general announcement or any other matter relevant to the membership of a tenants’ association.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(4) This section is not intended to require a landlord to permit any person to solicit money, except that a tenants’ association member, whether or not a tenant of the facility, may personally collect delinquent dues owed by an existing member of a tenants’ association.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(5) This section is not intended to require a landlord to permit any person to disregard a tenant’s request not to be canvassed. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>3.	 90.740 Tenant obligations. A tenant shall:</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(3) Behave, and require persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave, in compliance with the rental agreement and with any laws or ordinances that relate to the tenant’s behavior as a tenant.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(4) Except as provided by the rental agreement:</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(a) Use the rented space and the facility common areas in a reasonable manner considering the purposes for which they were designed and intended;</p>

<p>So, you see, this simply isn’t addressed in the landlord-tenant law.  Nor should it be.  Clearly, the resident leaving the religious material in the clubhouse could, if he or she wanted, go door to door proselytizing, unless and until others complained.  If the materials are left anonymously, without more than a single resident being offended, I’m not sure what the landlord could or should do.   Remove and destroy the materials?</p>
<p>If the landlord knows who is doing this, perhaps a personal discussion with them might be in order. But telling them to “stop” because a single person is offended seems unnecessary.  If there is a place in the clubhouse for storage of reading materials, perhaps removing the literature to that location would work.  Certainly, no rule change prohibiting placement of materials in the clubhouse (just because they are religious) is unnecessary.  Management cannot be responsible for controlling the placement of written materials in the clubhouse unless it is offensive, inappropriate for minors and guests.   This is what free speech is all about.  My view would be the same regardless of the denomination of the literature.  If I’m incorrect, I’m sure I will hear about it.</p>

"251","251","1","Manufactured Homes and  Sub Metering  ","<p>By Tiffany Mittal - Multifamily Utility Company</p>
<p>Manufactured Homes and Submetering   What is Submetering?</p>
<p>Submetering is the process of installing a water, gas or electric meter on each mobile home after the master utility meters for the mobile home park. The term “submeter” is used for any meter installed after the master meter. With submeters installed at every mobile home the association is able to utilize a third party meter reading and billing company to read the meters and produce monthly bills for the selected utilities.</p>
<p>Why Submeter?</p>
<p>One of the largest expenses for a mobile home park is utilities. It is also an expense item that continues to increase over time. There are three major reasons for this:</p>
<p>•	Rate Increases – The cost of energy (gas and electric) production and acquiring clean water has outpaced inflation for the past decade.</p>
<p>•	Increases in Occupancy – Due to the economic environment more people are living with extended families. Higher occupancy leads to higher utility usage.</p>
<p>•	Wasteful Usage - Residents are often less conservative with their utility usage when they are not aware of their individual consumption or do not have an incentive to save.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that once residents become aware of their utility usage, the total consumption will go down, on average around 22%.  According to a 2007 Santa Clara Water District study, Water Submetering in Mobile Home Parks, “Tenants who are individually metered can benefit by being able to monitor and control their water use – with submetering, they only pay for what they use, not what others use . . . the four mobile home parks examined shows an annual water savings of from 15 to 30%.”</p>
<p>Submetering makes economic sense for both the association and the residents. The water, gas and/or electric can be billed back to the residents thus reducing the overall association’s expenses. Without submetering, associations and property owners may be forced to pass the increased expenses evenly to all residents. This would unfairly increase costs for residents who are already conscious of their utility usage. The residents will benefit because they are now in control of their utility expenses.</p>
<p>Submeters and Automatic Meter Reading Systems (AMR)</p>
<p>There are many types of submeters that will accommodate any mobile home.  In areas where water pipes can freeze, you need to take measures to prevent the meters from freezing. For these applications there are meters with freeze plates or heat tape with insulation jackets. There are also a variety of gas and electric meters suitable for any environment. Submeters were once read by a “meter reader” who came to the property once a month to read the meters either manually or with a variety of handheld devices.  This outdated way of reading meters only provided the meter readings once a month, so if there were a leak on the property or a running toilet, hundreds of gallons of water would have already been wasted before the resident received their next bill.  The current way of reading submeters is through an Automatic Meter Reading System or (AMR).  AMR’s have a small transmitter connected to each meter that sends the meter reads wirelessly to a data collector located on the property.  The meter readings can then be downloaded daily and used to notify a property manager or resident if there is a sudden or steady increase in water usage.  The devices can pinpoint the exact meter and time the increased usage started so the leak can be resolved within days, not months.   Many submetering and billing companies can provide a web-based system with daily meter reads with their services.</p>
<p>How does it Work?</p>
<p>It is best to select a reputable submetering and billing company in the beginning to ensure you are getting the appropriate meters and AMR system for your property. These companies will typically handle all of the details, from the design and installation to the resident billing so you can start saving immediately. Following are some typical steps for a new installation:</p>
<p>1.	A complete property analysis is completed to determine the best submetering products for the desired application.</p>
<p>2.	Notices are issued to inform residents of the new submetering system.</p>
<p>3.	Equipment is ordered and depending on state and local regulations may be sent to a government office for inspection and testing. The meters would then be installed along with the AMR system.</p>
<p>4.	Resident information along with their meters is uploaded to a billing system and ready for processing.</p>
<p>5.	Meter information is read via (AMR) wireless transmitters and receivers and transmitted back to a billing company. Individual meter readings are then imported into a billing system and individual utility bills are created.</p>
<p>6.	Utility bills are sent directly to residents via U.S. Mail and/or electronically to e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>7.	The billing company will typically collects payments via multiple payment methods including check, money order, eCheck or major credit card. Online and phone payments are often accepted as well.</p>
<p>8.	A monthly utility reimbursement check is then sent to the owner, manager or association.</p>

"252","252","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Partial Payment Offered By Resident on the 5th of the Month","<p><strong>Question:</strong> A resident stops by the manager’s office on the 5th of the month and offers to pay $150 of the $350 of rent that is due, and promising to pay the remaining $200 by the 15th of the month.  The tenant claims that the landlord must accept the partial payment.  What are the landlord's options?  Can the landlord refuse the partial payment?  Where do you draw the line - say a 72 hour notice has been issued - does that change the partial payment scenario?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Oregon landlord-tenant law does not “require” that a landlord accept partial payments.  To the contrary, it provides that it is a “tenant’s duty regarding rent payments is to tender to the landlord an offer of the full amount of rent owed within the time allowed by law and by the rental agreement….”</p>
<p>A landlord may refuse to accept the tender of partial rent of rent that is not paid on time. However, if the landlord agrees to accept a partial payment of rent he/she may do so, although it should be clearly described in a well-drafted written agreement.</p>
<p>Such partial payments do not constitute a waiver of the right to later demand prompt performance in the future.  Nor do they prevent the landlord from terminating the tenancy if the balance of the rent is not paid as agreed.</p>
<p>However, there are some pitfalls that the landlord must be aware of: Acceptance of a partial payment waives the right of termination if accepted after issuance of a 72-hour or 144-hour notice of termination.</p>
<p>When presented with a partial payment issue, landlords are wise to closely review ORS 90.417.  Lastly, consistent application is important – i.e. if the landlord has permitted partial payments by some residents, he/she would be hard-pressed to disallow others the right to do so without good reason.    Here are a summary of how ORS 90.417 applies to this case:</p>
<p>•	A tenant’s duty regarding rent payments is to tender to the landlord an offer of the full amount of rent owed within the time allowed by law and by the rental agreement.</p>
<p>•	A landlord may refuse to accept a rent tender that is for less than the full amount of rent owed or that is untimely.</p>
<p>•	A landlord may accept a partial payment of rent. Doing so does not constitute a waiver, if properly documented.  Here is what the landlord must do to avoid waiver: o	The partial payment must have been made before the landlord issued a 72-hour or 144-hour notice for nonpayment. o	The landlord must enter into a written agreement with the tenant stating that the acceptance does not constitute waiver.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>o	The agreement should provide that the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as provided in the Oregon FED laws if the tenant fails to pay <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>the balance of the rent by a time certain.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>o	The tenant must agree in writing to pay the balance by a date/time certain.</p>
<p>•	If the balance is not paid according to this written agreement, the landlord may serve a 72-hour or 144-hour nonpayment of rent notice – but it must be served no earlier than would have been permitted under the rental agreement and the law, had no rent been accepted.</p>
<p>•	Notwithstanding a landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment of rent, the tenant continues to owe the landlord the unpaid balance of the rent.

The tenant claims that the landlord must accept the partial payment.  What are the landlord's options?  Can the landlord refuse the partial payment?

16.1	These rules and regulations are conditions pursuant to which HOMEOWNERS occupy COMMUNITY.  OWNER may enforce rules and regulations which are conditions of occupancy by terminating the lot rental agreement of the HOMEOWNER who violates a rule or regulation.  As an alternative to terminating a rental agreement, OWNER may impose a monetary fine on a violating HOMEOWNER in accordance with the dispute resolution process set forth in this section.

16.2	If the basis for terminating a rental agreement is within the dispute resolution process set forth in this section, OWNER will follow that process prior to terminating an agreement.

16.3	The dispute resolution process set forth in this section applies to disputes between HOMEOWNER and OWNER about certain of HOMEOWNER’S and OWNER'S obligations under the lot rental agreement and the rules and regulations.  The process is intended to serve as a vehicle for resolution of the minor disputes which commonly arise from time to time between OWNERS and HOMEOWNERS with respect to maintenance of premises, HOMEOWNER conduct which disturbs other HOMEOWNERS, and similar disputes.  The process applies to all disputes arising in connection with the lot rental agreement or these rules and regulations except for the types of disputes specifically excluded.

16.4	The dispute resolution process does not apply to the following disputes:

a)	any matters excluded by law from being a part of the dispute resolution process, including the amount of rent, rent increases, nonpayment of rent, or the closure or sale of COMMUNITY;

b)	charges due or claimed to be due under the lot rental agreement or the rules and regulations, including rent, services charge, assessed fine, landscaping deposit, permit fee, additional occupants or vehicles charge, attorneys' fees, late charge, bad check fee, or interest, or the adjustment, computation or modification of these charges;

c)	matters which are issues necessary to the resolution of disputes which are not subject to this dispute resolution process and are in litigation (i.e., whether proper notice was given, whether a party is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees, or the like);

d)	any claim for damages (which is otherwise subject to the process) where damages are reasonably anticipated to exceed $2000.00;

e)	any lien claim;

f)		termination of tenancy once written notice of termination has been given by OWNER, whether or not that notice has been received by HOMEOWNER;

g)	term of the lot rental agreement and renewal of the lease term;

h)	sale of its manufactured home by HOMEOWNER and OWNER'S acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a HOMEOWNER;

I)	disputes which involve a HOMEOWNER whose tenancy has been terminated by OWNER;

j)	  any HOMEOWNER action that has resulted in the issuance of a non-curable notice of default. 

OWNER encourages open discussion between itself and HOMEOWNER of any dispute which may arise between them in an effort to resolve that dispute.  Any attempt by any party to informally resolve a dispute shall not be deemed a waiver of that party's right to mediate or arbitrate the dispute.

16.5	The dispute resolution process is to be used for disputes between HOMEOWNER and OWNER and not disputes between HOMEOWNERS in COMMUNITY; however, if HOMEOWNER contends that another HOMEOWNER in COMMUNITY is violating one or more of these rules and regulations, HOMEOWNER may give OWNER notice in writing of the perceived violation, and OWNER will investigate it.  If OWNER concludes that a violation is occurring which unreasonably interferes with a HOMEOWNER’S peaceful enjoyment of COMMUNITY, OWNER will initiate the dispute resolution process by notifying the violating HOMEOWNER pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 16.6.

16.6	The dispute resolution works as follows:

a)	A party (HOMEOWNER or OWNER) initiates dispute resolution by giving written notice to the other party, in accordance with the lot rental agreement, of its desire to resolve a dispute by the dispute resolution process. To be effective, the written notice must specify that portion of the lot rental agreement or rules and regulations with which the dispute is concerned and offer two alternative dates/time in the following fifteen (15) day period when the party will be available to discuss resolution of the dispute.  If the notice is given by HOMEOWNER, it must also specify how HOMEOWNER proposes to resolve the dispute.  If given by OWNER, the notice must also specify what action OWNER proposes to take.

b)	After receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph 16.6(a), the receiving party will cooperate with the sending party in good faith to meet and discuss how the dispute might be resolved, with a view to reaching a resolution which takes into account the reasonable needs of all affected HOMEOWNERS in COMMUNITY and of OWNER.

c)	If the dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) days of the written notice specified in paragraph 16.6(a) having been sent, the party giving the notice will send a second written notice which refers to the first notice, specifies the portion of the lot rental agreement or rules and regulations concerned, and offers two alternative dates/times in the following fifteen (15) day period when the party will be available to discuss resolution of the dispute.  If the notice is given by HOMEOWNER, it must also specify how HOMEOWNER proposes to resolve the dispute.  If given by OWNER, the notice must also specify what action OWNER proposes to take.  If the action proposed by OWNER is assessment of a fine, the notice must specify the per day amount of the fine to be assessed.

d)	After receipt of a second notice as specified in paragraph 16.6(c), the parties will again cooperate in good faith to meet and discuss how the dispute might be resolved.  If the dispute has not been resolved after fifteen (15) days of the written notice specified in  having been sent, the dispute resolution process will be considered to be at an end, and any party may request mediation as set forth in section 16.1.  If a fine was assessed as a part of the dispute resolution process, the fine will be considered due and payable on the date the process is considered to be at an end.

16.7	Fines assessed by OWNER for violation of the lot rental agreement or these rules and regulations may not exceed $50.00 per day for a first violation.  If the HOMEOWNER against whom the fine is assessed has previously been assessed a fine for a similar violation, up to $100.00 per day may be assessed for the repeat violation.

16.8	OWNER may consider each day of a continuing violation for which an assessed fine is due and payable to be a separate violation to which the per day assessed fine applies, provided that OWNER so notifies HOMEOWNER in the second notice sent in accordance with paragraph 15.6(c).

16.9	HOMEOWNER’S payment of an assessed fine when due and payable is condition of occupancy, and failure of HOMEOWNER to pay an assessed fine when due is a basis for OWNER'S termination of the lot rental agreement.

16.10	Notwithstanding any other provision of the lot rental agreement or these rules and regulations to the contrary, neither HOMEOWNER nor OWNER will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees for any fees incurred in connection with the dispute resolution process set forth in this section.  The dispute resolution process is not intended to be a process in which representation of a party by an attorney will be necessary in order to effectively present that party's position.

16.11	No failure of OWNER to enforce any one of these rules and regulations shall operate as a waiver of its right to enforce that or others of the rules and regulations and to insist on strict compliance with the rules and regulations.

"256","256","3","Storage Agreement Default - Space Not Maintained - 3 Day Notice ","Question - A resident moves out of their house but the daughter continues to pay a storage fee and signed a MHCO Storage Agreement.  The home is not being occupied by anyone.  All storage fees are current. However, no one is maintaining the yard or outside of the home.  This is required under the Storage Agreement, and work needs to be performed immediately. The MHCO storage agreement refers to a three (3) day notice in the event of non-compliance.  Does the community owner give a 3-day notice for non-compliance?  If so, what happens next if there is no compliance? Does the landlord file an FED?  Should the landlord stop accepting storage payment?

Answer: You are referring to MHCO Form 35B “Manufactured Home Storage Agreement (With Homeowner).” Before addressing your specific questions, it is necessary to point out what this form is intended to do. Here are some that come quickly to mind: (a) A resident, living alone, moves out of the home and wants to sell it on site; (b) A person inherits or buys the home, but cannot be approved for occupancy due to the background check or their financial condition; (c) A resident, living alone, passes away, and the estate wants to sell it.

It is important to remember that this is a “storage” agreement not a “rental” agreement.  In fact, it expressly disclaims a “landlord-tenant” relationship between the community and the home owner.  Accordingly, the legal relationship is more akin to one in which a party stores their property in a commercial storage facility.

You should not treat a breach of the Storage Agreement as something that is remedied by going to FED court.  Rather, the provisions of Oregon law dealing with statutory liens in ORS 87.152 et. seq. apply. This process can get very complicated, and I highly recommend that you secure the services of an attorney before proceeding.

Lastly, the MHCO Storage Agreement contains a provision for mandatory arbitration, in lieu of any other court or legal process.  However, the box on the form must be checked in order for it to apply.  The reason that this arbitration alternative exists is because it was believed (and still is) that the process mandated by the statutes might be better implemented for park owners through arbitration, which can be cheaper, faster, and easier – especially if the matter becomes contested. 

The MHCO form does require that the home be maintained by the owner.  Accordingly, you may wish to consider sending a notice to the owner demanding that they do the clean-up work or you will do so, and pass the charge on to them.  I don’t think the issue of payments and maintenance are the same.  Accordingly, I don’t believe there is a need to discontinue accepting payments. However, all of this needs to be handled carefully, and for this you should speak with your attorney.

The former resident and owner of the home without notice to the landlord sells the ""abandoned"" home to another person.   Does the landlord have to send a new abandonment notice to the new owner and restart the 60 day clock?  

Answer: [Note: This answer presumes that the landlord has legally declared the abandonment, and following the statute regarding issuance of the 45-day letter. It also presumes that there are no liens on the home, since they would have prior right to determine what happens.]  

Interestingly, I find nothing in the abandonment statute [ORS 90.675] that prohibits the tenant from selling the home during the 45-day period following the landlord’s issuance of the 45-day letter.  In fact, I believe that possibility was contemplated when the statute was drafted and/or amended.  [My answer might be different if the tenant sold the home after expiration of the 45-day letter, since the statute says that under that circumstance the home is “conclusively presumed” to be abandoned.  To me this means that the tenant had nothing to convey.  But we’ll deal with that issue another time.]

So the real issue is not with the abandonment statute, but with ORS 90.680, which deals with on-site sales of the manufactured home.   In relevant part, the statute provides as follows:

1.	If the new purchaser wants to live in the home, prior to a sale, they “… must submit to the landlord a complete and accurate written application for occupancy of the dwelling or home as a tenant after the sale is finalized”;
2.	They may not occupy the space or the home until after the prospective purchaser is accepted by the landlord as a tenant;
3.	If the sale is not by a lienholder [it wasn’t] the prospective purchaser “…must pay in full all rents, fees, deposits or charges owed by the tenant *** prior to the landlord’s acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a tenant”;
4.	 The landlord must accept or reject the prospective purchaser’s application within seven days following the day the landlord receives a complete and accurate written application. If a tenant has not previously given the landlord the 10 days’ notice, this period is extended to 10 days;
5.	The landlord may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant;   
6.	The following apply if a landlord does not require a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant:
•	The landlord waives any right to bring an action against the tenant under the rental agreement for breach of the landlord’s right to establish conditions upon and approve a prospective purchaser of the tenant’s dwelling or home; 
•	 The prospective purchaser, upon completion of the sale, may occupy the dwelling or home as a tenant under the same conditions and terms as the tenant who sold the dwelling or home; and 
•	If the prospective purchaser becomes a new tenant, the landlord may not impose conditions or terms on the tenancy that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the seller’s rental agreement unless the new tenant agrees in writing.

So in this case, the landlord should immediately contact the new buyer, notify them that if they intend to occupy the home, they must submit an application for tenancy and bring current all unpaid accrued rents, etc. They may not occupy the home or space until they have done so and been approved as a tenant.  

If the purchaser is a dealer, or intending to flip the home to another prospective buyer/tenant, these same requirements would apply.  Although this may require a legal opinion before proceeding, if the current buyer intends to remove the home, I would consider asserting a possessory lien on the home [i.e. it cannot be removed until payment of the past due rents, etc.]  Note this is not “legal advice” so you must secure an opinion from your own counsel.

"258","258","3","Resident Guest Is A Sex Offender - Leaves and Now Returns - How to Evict","Question -   A tenant’s son has a conviction for sex abuse and is still on parole. He was living with his father in the community until neighbors found out about his conviction and began complaining about his presence because this is a family park with many children.  We informed the son’s father that he would have to leave due to his conviction.  He did leave but now he is doing odd jobs here in the park. He also comes into the park to visit his family.  We are getting resident complaints because people are still concerned for their children. Is there anything I can do as a manager to keep this man out of our community?

 Answer:  Your question raises several issues worthy of discussion. First, the fact that the son is in the park and you didn’t know he was a convicted sex offender, tells me that the park should beef up its rules to require all persons 18 years and over undergo a criminal background check. 

If the son is on parole, you may want to try to contact his parole officer.  I fully suspect that there may be conditions of his parole that may apply to keep him out of the park. 

At the risk of sounding harsh, it is a fact that “sexual predators” are not a protected class under the state and federal constitutions.  In short, you can have rules forbidding them to be in the park due to the proximity of children.  

If you don’t have such rules, you may want to enact some. But even though you don’t, I believe you did the right thing to require that he not occupy the home.  You can and should do the same thing with regards to forbidding him to come into the park at all.  If his family wants to see him, they can go to where he currently lives.  The person(s) who has/have hired him to do odd jobs should be told that he cannot come into the park for ANY reason.  

If you wonder whether this can be done without some specific rules, my response is that I would prefer rules to be in place.  But even though you presumably have nothing on point, it would not stop me from banning him from the park.  If he legally objects and wins, then it was a court that said he could come in – not you.  Your main duty is to the park residents and their children.  Better to try to remove him and fail than not to try at all.  

Lastly, for your information, ORS 90.630(1)(c), permits a landlord to terminate a tenant if it is determined that they are “a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587.”  From your question, I could not tell whether the adult son was on the rental agreement, but if so, he is a “tenant.”  The statute is not clear whether it can be applied to only a single tenant, without terminating the tenancy of the remaining occupants.  Of course, the statute doesn’t address the larger issue of whether you may prohibit him from coming into the park, but I believe you are fully within your rights, as discussed above.  However, you should first clear any such action with the park ownership, and they should secure legal advice on how to proceed.

(b) Can he bid during the sealed bid process?  (c) If no one bids on the house can the landlord purchase the house and at what price?

Answer:  All good questions.  The entire statute, which is lengthy, is found at ORS 90.675. 

(a)	Can a landlord acquire a home that is in abandonment?  Yes. Assuming that the abandonment process has been formally commenced, the landlord would have to wait for the 45 day period to expire and then if the property was over $8,000, it would have to be advertised and sold via sealed bid.  The landlord can bid, but must make sure that the bid is high enough that it’s not going to be snapped up by another higher bid.  If the property is worth $8,000 or less, the landlord could dismantle or give away to a non-profit organization.  But if the landlord wanted the home, he would have to advertise and auction and then pay the property taxes and could acquire it.  

(b)	Can he or she bid during the sealed bid process?  Yes, as mentioned above.  However, sealed bids mean sealed bids – no free peek by the landlord, so he knows how much to make his bid for.  The playing field must be level.  

(c)	If no one bids on the house can the landlord purchase it and at what price?  Generally this should not come up, since the landlord would normally put in his own “protective bid” which is just a credit bid and represents the amount of costs and fees he’s got into the abandonment process.  Thus, if no one else were to bid, the landlord would acquire it for the “protective bid.”  

The above discussion does not factor in what happens if there is a lender.  If there is, then the entire time frame is subject to what the lender does.  If it signs and returns the Storage Agreement, then the lender will have the right to try to sell the property itself. However, if the lender does not sign and return the Storage Agreement, or otherwise fails to respond to the landlord, then its interest is “conclusively presumed to be abandoned.”  

Note, however, that when the home is advertised prior to the private auction, the invitation to bid submitted to the newspaper for publishing must also be provided to the lender – even though it didn’t respond to the original 45-day notice.  This is sometimes forgotten, since landlords assume that if the lender didn’t respond or timely exercise their right to sell the property, they don’t have a right to know when the auction is held.  They do have the right to know, and the right to bid.  Forgetting this can create headaches for landlords after they have sold the property to someone else.  
","Question – Three abandonment questions: (a) Can a landlord acquire a home that is in abandonment?  (b) Can he bid during the sealed bid process?  (c) If no one bids on the house can the landlord purchase the house and at what price?

The landlord wants to give a 30 day notice.  Any issues the landlord should be aware of since it was video-taped?  If the accused resident does nothing wrong again in the community after the 30-day notice has been served - then he gets to stay correct?  Even though he does not return the camera or pay damages?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> This is really a 24-hour notice issue.  The applicable statute, ORS 90.396, gives you the right to issue a non-curable 24-hour notice.  The theft constitutes (in my opinion) “outrageous conduct,” for which the notice may issue.   However, it is true that the statute states that a landlord should not issue a 24-hour notice if a 30-day curable notice would suffice.  I suggest that you talk to the resident and tell him he’s got two choices: (a) Either return the stolen property, pay the cost to re-install and take a curable 30-day notice; or (b) Take a 24-hour non-curable notice under ORS 90.630 (for any number of reasons, such as violation of law – i.e. theft – violation of rules or rental agreement re damage to park property).  If there is a repeat violation within six months following the date of issuance of the 30-day notice, then you can give him a 20-day non-curable notice to terminate the tenancy.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If I give 24-hour notice for a dog and they correct the situation by removing the dog but the same dog or substantially the same offense occurs in 3 months what does the landlord do?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You don’t say why you want to issue a 24-hour notice for the dog.  It must be serious, such as a real threat or actual damage to a person in the park (other than the pet owner).  The applicable statute is ORS 90.396(2) which provides:</p>
<p>“If the cause for a termination notice *** is based upon the acts of the tenant’s pet, the tenant may cure the cause and avoid termination of the tenancy by removing the pet from the premises prior to the end of the notice period.  The notice must describe the right of the tenant to cure the cause. If the tenant returns the pet to the premises at any time after having cured the violation, the landlord, after at least 24 hours’ written notice specifying the subsequent presence of the offending pet, may terminate the rental agreement and take possession (of the space).</p>
<p>In those cases in which the offence is not sufficient to issue a 24-hour notice you have two other options: (a) Fine the resident under the Pet Agreement, if one has been entered into; or (b) issuance of the 30-day curable 30-day notice if your rules have been violated.</p>","<p><strong>Question:</strong> A community’s security camera taped one of the residents one night cutting the line and stealing the camera.

	-Overview
	-Rental Application Process
	-The Rental Application Form


Overview

As a community manager, you will normally be charged with accepting or rejecting prospective residents.  This is one of the most important functions that you will perform as a manager of a manufactured home community.  Done properly and effectively, the rental application and screening process will minimize potential problems in landlord – resident relations.  If the process is done incorrectly the seeds of future problems will be sown.  Every prospective resident should be given sufficient information to make an informed decision about living in a manufactured home community.  

When an individual stops by the manufactured home community office inquiring on the possibility of becoming a resident, always give them an application packet.  

Anyone who is interested in applying should be given the application packet – inconsistency in giving out application packets could lead to claims by the resident selling the home, or a fair housing violation. 

If yours is a family park, i.e. accepting all ages, avoid becoming engaged in discussions about the suitability of the community for children.  Questions such as “Is the park ‘child friendly’ or similar inquiries, are too subjective to answer. Responding to similar questions, either in person or on the phone, regarding other protected class, e.g. race, religion, national origin, sexual preference (in some Oregon cities), etc., should be avoided. Remember, Fair Housing “testers” could be asking in order to see if you answer differently at different times.  Simply inform prospective tenants that they may tour the park, speak with other residents, past and present, and make their own determination.

Include in the application packet an application and “Minimum Criteria Standards”, optional information may include what homes are available in the community, a community newsletter, information on the history of the community, the advantages of living in a manufactured home community etc.  NOTE: ORS 90.680(5) requires the following:

“If a landlord requires a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant under subsection (4) of this section, at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser an application the landlord shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale, all as provided by ORS 90.510. The terms of the statement, rental agreement and rules and regulations need not be the same as those in the selling tenant’s statement, rental agreement and rules and regulations.” (Emphasis added.)

ORS 90.680 covers the entire selling process. You should review the statute in its entirety.

Rental Application Process

The overall rental application process should include:

1.	Review application to make sure it has been completely filled out. If not completed, it should be promptly returned to the applicant.  Do not keep the application for several days and then return it to complete. Oregon law requires tenants give management not less than ten (10) days written notice before the sale of their home.  If the tenant does so, then management has seven (7) days within which to accept or reject an applicant who has submitted a fully completed application.  However, a longer period may be  agreed upon between the manager and the applicant. Your MHCO application form permits you and the applicant to agree upon a longer time. If the current tenant has not given management the 10-day advance written notice of sale, then the manager has ten (10) days to accept or reject. WARNING: The failure to timely accept or reject means that the prospective tenant will be accepted on the same terms as contained in the selling tenant’s rental agreement.  If you and an applicant agree upon an extension of time to process their paperwork, make sure that the agreement is in writing and signed.
2.	Check to make sure that the applicant has included a valid social security number, driver license information etc. NOTE: To avoid claims of discrimination based upon race, country of origin or ethnicity, you must be consistent with all applicants. If you insist upon one applicant having a valid social security number, you must require it of all.  Do not make exceptions.  Remember: Fair Housing testers will be watching for inconsistency.  
3.	Provide the applicant with a copy of the Statement of Policy (keep a signed copy or receipt for your file), the rent history of the space, Rental Agreement/Lease, Park Rules & Regulations, RV Storage Agreement and Pet Agreement (if applicable).  None of these are to be signed by you until they have been reviewed and accepted by you. The Statement of Policy statute is ORS 90.510. You should review it from time to time.
4.	Collect application fee.
5.	Provide prospective resident with application fee receipt.
6.	Conduct credit, rental and criminal check.
7.	Attach copies of credit, rental and criminal check to application.
8.	If credit, rental and criminal checks are acceptable contact prospective resident.
9.	If they are denied and they are purchasing an existing home in the park, send them an application denial form.  Also, send a copy to the resident selling the home and one for the tenant’s file. NOTE: Make sure your existing residents understand that you are not required to accept prospective residents until they have successfully completed the application process and have been approved for residency. 

The Rental Application Form

The Rental Application form provides the basic information needed to make a decision on accepting the applicant.  As noted above, unless a longer time has been agreed upon in writing, current Oregon Law gives you either (a) up to seven (7) days from receipt of the application to accept or reject (if the tenant-seller gave you the required advance ten (10) days’ notice of sale) or (b) up to ten (10) days (if the tenant-seller did not give you the 10-day notice). Used properly, the rental application and personal interview will prove helpful in countering charges of discrimination in renting spaces.  When completed, a rental application should reveal:

•	Financial information
•	Employment information
•	Residence history 
•	Household members
•	Social security number(s)
•	Driver license number(s)
•	Ownership or lien-holder of the unit 
•	Age, size and condition of the unit 
•	Information about motor vehicles 
•	Pets
•	Age verification if the community is classified as 55 or older or 62 or older housing
•	Credit references
•	Emergency contacts
•	Authorization to do credit and criminal checks 
•	Acknowledgement of receipt of disclosure documents

At the time the prospective tenant is given an application for residency, the manager or landlord must also provide the prospective tenant with copies of the Statement of Policy (with required exhibits), which includes the rent history of the space, the Rental Agreement and the Rules and Regulations and a map of the facility. 

Have a receipt form to give to all persons to whom you have provided a Statement of Policy. Make sure that you receive and retain all signed receipts, as they are proof of delivery of the Statement of Policy.  If the prospective resident is approved for occupancy, then put the signed receipt in their file together with their signed statement of policy.  Retain copies of ALL receipts of delivery in a separate file, including those confirming delivery of the Statements of Policy to persons who did not return their applications or whose applications were rejected. 

Take time to make sure the prospective resident is aware of the content of each of these documents.  It will do the community or the resident little good to have the prospective resident move in without taking the time to read and understand the Statement of Policy, the rent history of the space, the Rental Agreement and the Rules and Regulations.

"270","270","3","Bill Miner Question  and Answer  on Recreational Vehicles","Question: Do I have to have a written rental agreement for “temporary” RVs in my community?
 
Answer: The answer they teach lawyers in law school to always give is, “it depends.”  I usually hate giving that answer, but in this case it truly does depend.  ORS 90.230 is the operative statute.  The answer is dependent on whether or not the tenancy is a “vacation occupancy” (See below).
 
Oregon law dictates that if a tenancy is for the occupancy of an RV in a park (RV or manufactured home) then the landlord shall provide a written rental agreement.  The rental agreement (which MHCO can provide) must state that:

1.       The tenancy may be terminated without cause upon a 30 day notice (for a month to month tenancy less than a year), a 60 day notice (for a month to month tenancy more than a year) or a 10 day notice (for a week to week tenancy);

2.       That any accessory building or structures provided by the tenant belongs to the tenant and that the landlord required removal upon termination of the tenancy; and

3.       The tenancy is subject to the requirements of ORS 197.493(1) (which talks about local governments cannot place limits on the placement of an RV).

Therefore, yes, you must have a written rental agreement with these provisions in it.

However, the Legislature exempts “vacation occupancies.”  ORS 90.100(48) defines a “vacation occupancy” where the occupant rents the space for vacation purposes only and not as a principal residence; the occupant has a principal residence other than that at the space; and the period of authorized occupancy does not exceed 45 days. 

If your residents are merely passing through and they have a residence somewhere else, you don’t need a written agreement; but if your residents do not meet all of these requirements then you should have a written rental agreement.

Not having a written rental agreement is not a defense to an eviction action; however, the statute does provide a penalty of actual damages or twice the periodic rent if you evict a person without giving them a written rental agreement.

If in doubt, give the tenant a rental agreement. A written agreement is always better.

In addition to the Statement of Policy which includes copies of the rules and rental agreement, you should provide the applicant the following:

•	Criminal check authorization 
•	Resident applicant screening fee should be acquired prior to accepting the individual as a resident.  “Application Screening Fee and Receipt” form is to be signed by a manager when applicant’s fees are accepted.
•	The landlord must give written notice of what the tenant screening or consumer credit report entails, the landlord’s charge for the screening, and the applicant’s right to dispute the screening service or credit reporting agency’s information if the application is denied based on the credit report.
•	Minimum Screening Criteria Standards

At this point the above documents are to be provided to the prospective applicant.  However, only the application, the criminal check authorization, the Statement of Policy receipt, and the applicant screening fee notice and receipt should be signed by the tenant.  The Rental Agreement and Rules should never be signed by the prospective resident until after management approval of occupancy.  

Screening Criteria – Minimum Standards

Your “Screening Criteria” is another important document that should be provided to an interested applicant.  This is the document that will determine where you draw the line between acceptance and denial.  Your “Screening Criteria” is a written statement of the factors the landlord considers in deciding whether to accept or reject an applicant and any qualification required for acceptance.  What can you have on that list?  Look at your standard rental agreement.  If you’re using the MHCO form, it contains a list of criteria.  Your Screening Criteria should consist of the same items, although you may want to refine some of the requirements, such as financial capacity to afford the space rent (e.g. debt to income ratios), etc. 

Here is a brief list to get you started: unsatisfactory rental references, the absence of any prior tenant history or credit history, unsatisfactory character references, criminal history, bankruptcy filed in the past two years, payment of rent problems, no social security number, and inaccurate information on the application, insufficient debt to income ratio.  All of these are reasons for denial – it is up to you establish them as a basis for acceptance into you community.  For example – maybe you accept applicants with felony conviction that are 20 years or older – it is up to you to include that on your screening criteria.

Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations – write a “screening criteria” and apply it uniformly.  Used properly and consistently it can be a tool that keeps you above any suspicion of discrimination.  The one limit on your screening criteria is that you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or sources of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone – even if they are in a protected class – if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria that you establish in your screening criteria.  Often potential applicants will “self-screen” themselves by reading your “screening criteria” and realizing that they do not qualify, thus saving you and the potential applicant time and energy.

Screening/Admission Criteria: This may include:

•	Unsatisfactory rental references
•	Applicant must be 18 years or older
•	Provide two pieces of identification, one with each applicant’s photo from a government office (i.e. Driver’s License, State ID Card, Passport) and Social Security Card
•	Be gainfully employed or have verifiable income from retirement, social security or periodic income.
•	If the community is either an “age 55 or older” or an “age 62 or older” Community, you must provide proof that you meet the age requirements
•	The absence of any prior negative tenant or credit history
•	Unsatisfactory credit history or no credit history
•	Unsatisfactory character references
•	Any criminal history (You may wish to distinguish felonies from misdemeanors, or crimes of violence versus non-violent crimes, or the lapse of time since conviction, etc.)
•	Insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly rental and other expense obligations 
•	Presence of pets or the number, type or size of pets
•	Evidence that the prospective tenant has provided landlord with falsified or materially misleading information on any material items
•	If the prospective tenant refuses to sign a new written rental agreement or lease agreement
•	The number of additional occupants
•	Adverse information contained in the public record

Additional criteria may include:

•	Minimum two-year verifiable references with previous landlords
•	No payment of rent problems over the past two years
•	Two years of verifiable employment
•	No criminal convictions
•	No tax liens
•	Sufficient income to pay all outstanding obligations after payment of rent 
•	Any individual who is a current illegal substance abuser, or has been convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance will be denied tenancy
•	Any individual or pet/animal whose residency would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals.
•	If pets are permitted they must meet the requirements of state and local laws, ordinances, and the Community in regards to number, size and breed.  Farm animals, exotic and/or wild animals, livestock and certain breeds of dogs.  You should list breeds of dogs that are not allowed in your community (Note that if the animal is presented as a “Service Animal” there are special rules that may limit your ability to reject.  In some cases, it is wise to first seek legal advice before rejection.)
•	You may want to set a percentage of net-income that should be left over after meeting all financial obligations.
•	Homes must be owner occupied – no subleasing

You MUST post your community’s screening criteria publicly in the office and provide written copies to all prospective residents.

Take your time!  If the application is incomplete immediately return it with the explanation you can only process completed applications.  If you think you will need more time, you can insert a longer time on the application, such as 15 days.  Make sure the prospective resident signs the application agreeing to this. Don’t make snap judgments. Remember that Oregon law provides that a landlord or manager “may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant.”  You will be required to give a written notice of rejection, so make sure you have given proper consideration to the basis for rejection.  It is a good idea to maintain all rejected applications and supporting information for a period of at least three years.  Tenant screening is a very important part of community management and it should not be done without reason and consistency.  Tenant screening cannot be based on your personal feelings or emotions.

Remember - the “Ideal Resident”:
1.	Pays the rent on time.
2.	Keeps the outside of the manufactured home and the space in a clean and well maintained manner.
3.	Does not litter, damage or destroy community property.
4.	Does not disturb the neighbors.

The key to identifying the “Ideal Resident” is a thorough and complete processing of the rental application and the supplemental verification forms, combined with a personal interview of the prospective tenant.  “Snap judgments” or a “hurry to rent the space” must be avoided.

A thorough screening is your best resource for finding good residents.  Current residents in surrounding home sites will feel more secure knowing their neighbors have also been screened.
","Documents Provided To Prospective Residents

In addition to the Statement of Policy which includes copies of the rules and rental agreement, you should provide the applicant the following:

"273","273","3","Rental Application Process  (Part 2 of 6): Documents to Provide Prospective Residents; Screening Criteria","Documents Provided To Prospective Residents

In addition to the Statement of Policy which includes copies of the rules and rental agreement, you should provide the applicant the following:

•	Criminal check authorization 
•	Resident applicant screening fee should be acquired prior to accepting the individual as a resident.  “Application Screening Fee and Receipt” form is to be signed by a manager when applicant’s fees are accepted.
•	The landlord must give written notice of what the tenant screening or consumer credit report entails, the landlord’s charge for the screening, and the applicant’s right to dispute the screening service or credit reporting agency’s information if the application is denied based on the credit report.
•	Minimum Screening Criteria Standards

At this point the above documents are to be provided to the prospective applicant.  However, only the application, the criminal check authorization, the Statement of Policy receipt, and the applicant screening fee notice and receipt should be signed by the tenant.  The Rental Agreement and Rules should never be signed by the prospective resident until after management approval of occupancy.  

Screening Criteria – Minimum Standards

Your “Screening Criteria” is another important document that should be provided to an interested applicant.  This is the document that will determine where you draw the line between acceptance and denial.  Your “Screening Criteria” is a written statement of the factors the landlord considers in deciding whether to accept or reject an applicant and any qualification required for acceptance.  What can you have on that list?  Look at your standard rental agreement.  If you’re using the MHCO form, it contains a list of criteria.  Your Screening Criteria should consist of the same items, although you may want to refine some of the requirements, such as financial capacity to afford the space rent (e.g. debt to income ratios), etc.

The landlord wants to mail a non-payment of rent notice, and would like proof that the notice was received by the resident.  Can the landlord mail the notice as a ""Certificate of Mailing""?

Answer:  If the tenant has left the home, this does not mean that the landlord’s non-payment of rent notices must follow the tenant around the country in order to be effective.  Rather, in cases where the tenant apparently abandons the home (or at least is ignoring his/her space rent responsibilities while gone), the landlord should send the 72-hour notice to the tenant at the tenant’s space.  If the tenant has another address known to the landlord, he an send a “courtesy copy” so marked, with an advisory that the original was sent to the space.  Upon expiration of the 72 hours without payment, the landlord may file for eviction. If the tenant does not show up at the first appearance, the landlord may obtain a judgment of restitution and recover back possession of the space.  Then the landlord may send out a 45-day abandonment letter.  A Certificate of Mailing (this is not “certified mail”) is always useful when sending notices, and certainly appropriate here.

When any existing resident intends to sell their manufactured home the resident must do the following:

1.	Give the landlord a written 10-day notice of their intent to sell their manufactured home.  (Note: The 10 days will run parallel with the 7 day application process – i.e. if the resident notifies the landlord of intent to sell the home and does not give the 10 day notice, then the application process time to approve or reject can take nor more 10 days - rather than 7 days.  If you want more time, insert the longer time on the MHCO Application form and have the prospective resident sign it.)

2.	The existing resident must advise the prospective purchaser that they have to fill out an application with the landlord and be approved.

3.	Do not move anyone into the manufactured home that has not been approved through the tenant screening and approval process and signed all necessary documents, including the rental agreement.

If you are aware of a sale and do not have the purchaser fill out an application, or fail to advise the seller and prospective purchaser in writing that the application has been rejected within the applicable period of time (seven days, tens days or longer, as discussed above) after they fill out the application, then the purchaser can move into the mobile home under the same condition of the rental agreement of the seller.  Basically, they assume the existing rental agreement you have with the current resident who is the seller of the manufactured home.

If a prospective tenant refuses to provide you with the necessary information for you to qualify them, then it is an automatic denial of the applicant.

It is important that an application is filled out and you check out the person carefully.  You should check them out the same as you do any prospective resident.  You do not have to approve the person just because they are buying an existing home in the park.  If they have a bad credit or rental history, they can be refused as a prospective tenant.  This does not necessarily kill the sale of the mobile home.  They can still purchase the home, they just cannot keep it in the park.  You need to provide a written rejection to both the seller and prospective purchaser.  You need to advise them why they were not accepted.  If you denied them for credit reasons, give the applicant the name and phone number of the company who provided you with the report.  Advise the applicant that they can call them if they have any questions regarding the report.  

If a resident sells their home and the new owner of the home has not filled out an application prior to moving into the home, you do not need to accept them as a resident.  You have no contract with them and you can request them to remove the home from the park.  

DO NOT ALLOW PROSPECTIVE TENANTS TO MOVE IN BEFORE THE SCREENING PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLETED, AND THE APPLICANT HAS BEEN APPROVED AND SIGNED, AND RECEIPTED FOR THE STATEMENT OF POLICY, RULES AND REGULATIONS AND RENTAL AGREEMENT.  DO NOT ACCEPT RENT FROM ANYONE THAT YOU HAVE NOT APPROVED TO LIVE IN THAT HOME.  

If you accept rent before you qualify them then you may have established them as a tenant.  Simply tell them that you cannot accept the rent until they fill out an application and are accepted by the landlord.

"295","295","3","Phil Querin Q&A Partial Rent Payment & Allocation to Utilities, Fees etc.","Question:  Increasingly some of our residents are bringing only partial rent payments. So how does a partial payment get allocated when some of the payment includes utilities?  For example, if the rent is $650 including a certain amount allocated to utilities, how does the landlord handle this?  Pay the rent portion and then go after the utility payments via a 30 day notice?  

Answer:  Be aware that utility charges, late fees, etc. are not “rent.”  Rent is the charge for the resident’s right to remain at the space.  As you know from the MHCO 72-hour Notice, the right to evict only arises when the rent remains unpaid for seven days following the date of payment, which is usually the first of the month. The extra charges for late fees, utilities, and other expenses the landlord has a right to collect under the rental or lease agreement do not provide the basis for eviction under the 72-hour Notice.  A landlord’s right to terminate a tenancy for payment of non-rent charges can be handled in two ways: (a) By issuance of a 30-day notice of termination; or (b) Small Claims Court. 

If the resident’s payment does not include 100% of the rent that is due, that is a different story.  In that case, the landlord does not have to accept partial rent.  However, if a landlord is willing to do so, he/she must secure a written agreement. 

Here’s what ORS 90.417 says:
•	A landlord may accept a partial payment of rent. 
•	If the acceptance of a partial payment of rent is in accordance with the following protocol, it does not constitute a waiver of the landlord’s right to terminate the tenancy for nonpayment of the balance of the rent owed.  
•	Here is the required protocol:  Acceptance of a partial payment of rent waives the right of the landlord to terminate the tenant’s rental agreement for nonpayment of rent unless:
o	 The landlord accepted the partial payment of rent before he/she gave a nonpayment of rent notice based on the tenant’s agreement to pay the balance by a time certain and the tenant does not pay the balance of the rent as agreed;
o	The landlord’s 72-hour notice must be served no earlier than it would have been permitted under the 72-hour notice statute, had no rent been accepted; and
o	The notice permits the tenant to avoid termination of the tenancy for nonpayment of rent by paying the balance within 72 hours or 144 hours, as the case may be, or by any date to which the parties agreed, whichever is later; or 
o	 The landlord accepted a partial payment of rent after giving a nonpayment of rent termination notice and entered into a written agreement with the tenant that the acceptance does not constitute waiver. The written agreement may provide that the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and file for eviction without serving a new 72-hour notice if the tenant fails to pay the balance of the rent by a time certain.
             
•	Note that a landlord and tenant may by written agreement provide that monthly rent can be paid in regular installments of less than a month pursuant to a schedule specified in the agreement. Such installment rent payments are not partial payment of rent under ORS 90.417.

However, we are confused about the 80/20 rules and the possibility of losing our 55+ status. What is a safe margin for occupancy limits?  And if our community percentage is 85%, are we required to rent the 15% remainder to families with children?  

Answer:  You must have at least one person who is 55 years of age or older living in at least 80% of its occupied units. This 80/20 rule is critical.   Generally, communities strive to be over 80%, since falling below 80% occupancy [even upon death of a qualifying 55+ resident] means immediate disqualification.  Does this mean that your 15% safety margin must be reserved for families with children?  The answer is “No.”  In fact, a 55+ community should strive for 100% occupancy by persons age 55 or over.  Does it mean that community management must accept otherwise qualified age 55+ applicants when the second or subsequent person occupant is 18 years of age?  Again, the answer is “No.”  If desired, a 55+ community may impose a minimum age requirement for the second or subsequent occupant to 25 years, 30 years, or even 55+ years.   

However, it is also important for you to publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent to operate as a 55+ community. This requirement is fairly self-explanatory; i.e. you should make sure that in all advertising, rules, rental agreements, and  policies, you always hold the community out as a 55+ facility.  

Lastly, you must comply with HUD’s age verification of occupancy procedures to substantiate compliance with the requirement that at least 80% of the community is intended to be occupied by at least one person age 55 or over. The law provides that the following documents are considered reliable for such verification: (1) Driver’s license; (2) Birth certificate; (3) Passport; (4) Immigration card; (5) Military identification; (6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability or; (7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.

A landlord may require payment of an applicant screening charge solely to cover the costs of obtaining information about an applicant as the landlord processes the application for a rental agreement. 

This activity is known as screening, and includes but is not limited to checking references and obtaining a consumer credit report or tenant screening report. The landlord must provide the applicant with a receipt for any applicant screening charge.

The amount of any applicant screening charge shall not be greater than the landlord’s average actual cost of screening applicants. Actual costs may include the cost of using a tenant screening company or a consumer credit reporting agency, and may include the reasonable value of any time spent by the landlord or the landlord’s agents in otherwise obtaining information on applicants. In any case, the applicant screening charge may not be greater than the customary amount charged by tenant screening companies or consumer credit reporting agencies for a comparable level of screening.

A landlord may not require payment of an applicant screening charge unless prior to accepting the payment the landlord:
•	Adopts written screening or admission criteria;
•	Gives written notice to the applicant of:
o	The amount of the applicant screening charge;
o	The landlord’s screening or admission criteria;
o	The process that the landlord typically will follow in screening the applicant, including whether the landlord uses a tenant screening company, credit reports, public records or criminal records or contacts employers, landlords or other references; and
o	 The applicant’s rights to dispute the accuracy of any information provided to the landlord by a screening company or credit reporting agency;
•	Gives actual notice to the applicant of an estimate, made to the best of the landlord’s ability at that time, of the approximate number of rental units of the type, and in the area, sought by the applicant that are, or within a reasonable future time will be, available to rent from that landlord. The estimate shall include the approximate number of applications previously accepted and remaining under consideration for those units. (A good faith error by a landlord in making an estimate under this paragraph does not provide grounds for a claim against the landlord.)
•	Gives written notice to the applicant of the amount of rent the landlord will charge and the deposits the landlord will require, subject to change in the rent or deposits by agreement of the landlord and the tenant before entering into a rental agreement.

Regardless of whether a landlord requires payment of an applicant screening charge, if a landlord denies an application for a rental agreement by an applicant and that denial is based in whole or in part on a tenant screening company or consumer credit reporting agency report on that applicant, the landlord shall give the applicant actual notice of that fact at the same time that the landlord notifies the applicant of the denial. 

Unless written notice of the name and address of the screening company or credit reporting agency has previously been given, the landlord shall promptly give written notice to the applicant of the name and address of the company or agency that provided the report upon which the denial is based.

A landlord may give to an applicant a copy of that applicant’s consumer report, as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Unless the applicant agrees otherwise in writing, a landlord may not require payment of an applicant screening charge when the landlord knows or should know that no rental spaces are available at that time or will be available within a reasonable future time.

If a landlord requires payment of an applicant screening charge but fills the vacant rental unit before screening the applicant or does not conduct a screening of the applicant for any reason, the landlord must refund the applicant screening charge to the applicant within a reasonable time.

"302","302","3","Phil Querin Q&A Major Management Mistakes - Identifying Issues Before They Spiral Out of Control","Question.  As new managers, we are concerned about being able to spot problem issues before they get out of control.  What are some of the major management mistakes we should watch out for? 

Answer:  There are several issues that I see repeatedly.  Here are a few:

1.	Managers not adequately papering their file before taking legal action against a resident.  Judges want to see that you’ve “walked the extra mile” with the resident, making every reasonable effort to bring them into compliance.  This means starting with a personal conversation with them about the problem and then making notes of the date, time, and matters discussed and the resident’s responses. Next try a note or letter without using a formal termination notice.  Only after it becomes apparent that you will have to go the formal route should you do so.  

2.	Failing to act promptly when a resident violate the rules.  Although many things are not waivable, such as maintenance violations, some definitely are, such as unpermitted pets or occupants.  When there is a belief that the resident has either an unapproved pet or occupant, the resident should be contacted immediately.  With pets (assuming they are not in violation of the rules against breeds, or numbers), you want to promptly get them onto a Pet Agreement.  With occupants you should use the Occupancy Agreement and run a background check.  (Make sure you don’t require a financial background check, since that is not permitted on occupants – only tenants.)  If the resident delays in complying, get a 30-day notice issued and do not accept rent until the matter is resolved.  I have seen too many managers accept rent and work for months with the resident, not realizing that they are being lulled into believing the resident will ultimately cooperate – until it’s too late.

3.	Failing to properly prepare a notice of termination.  Oregon law is very strict when it comes to the preparation of notices.  Even the slightest error can be fatal.  Make sure you’re using the correct MHCO form [e.g. don’t use a 30-day notice for failure to maintain under ORS 90.630, when you should be using a 30-day notice for repair and deterioration under ORS 90.632.]  When you draft the notice, have someone else read it for content and accuracy.  Then do so again yourself.  If you realize that you sent out an incorrectly prepared notice, send out a corrected one and state that it rescinds and replaces the incorrect one.   

4.	Accepting residents you have doubts about.  Always do a “gut-check.”  If you think the applicant would be problematic, look closely at their application and references.  While you cannot and should not reject applicants arbitrarily, if they are on the cusp – i.e. you could legitimately accept or reject - give careful consideration to your decision and don’t let it be dictated by your desire to just fill a space. 

5.	Not understanding the range of solutions when dealing with a residents.  By this I mean, don’t just fire out a notice as a knee jerk reaction to a violation.  A good example is a resident who is intoxicated and gets into a verbal altercation with another resident.  Say it gets out of control, and threats are made by the resident.   If this is unusual for the resident and out of character for him, don’t simply send a 24-hour notice.  The law is quite clear that you are not to use a 24-hour notice if another form of notice, e.g. a curable 30-day notice would work.  Remember, a repeat violation with six months following the date of the 30-day notice gives you the right to terminate with a 20-day non-curable notice.  Judges don’t like to terminate manufactured housing residents, given the drastic consequences.  You want to show the judge that you were not being heavy-handed, but tried the most rationale and reasonable approach first.

"303","303","3","Phil Querin Q&A Trees - Liability and Responsibility ","Question.  Our community is relatively small and the spaces are oversized.  Large trees are located on many of them.  Occasionally, a resident asks us to thin or top some of the trees on their space, because of fear that during high winds they could break, damaging homes and injuring people.  I have been under the impression that tree maintenance is a tenant responsibility under Oregon law.  If so, what is our liability if tree limbs – or entire trees - break during bad weather?  

Answer:  Oregon law addresses tenant responsibilities in ORS 90.740.  Subsection (4)(h) says that except as provided in the rental agreement it is the tenant’s responsibility to “(m)aintain, water and mow or prune any trees, shrubbery or grass on the rented space….”

In my opinion, this provision is a good example of how not to draft a statute.  Trees are not “mowed” and grass is not “pruned.”  However, it is correct that “pruning” of trees [whatever that entails] is a tenant responsibility unless otherwise provided in the rental or lease agreement.

As with everything these days, the Internet is replete with discussions and definitions of pruning. One example is found here: http://tinyurl.com/Q-Law-Definitions-pruning. Regardless of your reference source, it is clear that there are many, many, different types of pruning, depending upon the goal sought.  You can prune to “teach” a tree or shrub how to grow in a particular fashion; you can prune for appearance; you can prune for maintenance, i.e. the health of the tree or shrub.  Lastly, you prune for safety - this is called “hazard pruning.” 

Putting my “lawyer’s hat” on and returning to my law school roots, I recall a rule of interpretation called “ejusdem generis”.  Here is one definition:
“(eh-youse-dem generous) v adj. Latin for ""of the same kind,"" used to interpret loosely written statutes. Where a law lists specific classes of persons or things and then refers to them in general, the general statements only apply to the same kind of persons or things specifically listed. Example: if a law refers to automobiles, trucks, tractors, motorcycles and other motor-powered vehicles, ""vehicles"" would not include airplanes, since the list was of land-based transportation.” http://www.legal-explanations.com/definitions/ejusdem-generis.htm 

Applying that legal rule to ORS 90.740(4)(h), it could reasonably be argued that the words “maintain, water and mow or prune” are intended to refer to normal and routine landscaping activities.  In other words, a tenant’s landscaping responsibility for his or her own space is limited to normal and routine activities.  In other words, imposing a statutory duty and financial responsibility of “hazard pruning” on manufactured housing residents was unlikely. 

ORS 90.730(3) provides that “(f)or purposes of this section, a rented space is considered inhabitable if it substantially lacks: (e) At the time of commencement of the rental agreement, buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin [underscore mine];”
Thus, there is little question that as of the commencement of the tenancy, it is a landlord duty to make sure the community grounds, including the spaces and common areas, are safe for “normal and reasonably foreseeable uses….”  Is a 40-foot fir tree “safe” at the commencement of the tenancy?  Can it be made safe?  If it is made safe, e.g. by hazard trimming, will it stay safe for the entire duration of the tenancy?  

It seems to me that a community landlord has two choices:

1.	Doing nothing, and relying upon a poorly drafted statute for absolute immunity when a giant tree falls, killing an entire family during a windstorm; or 
 
2.	Envision the Doomsday Scenario – i.e. assume that such a disaster could occur regardless what a poorly drafted statute says, and that a multi-million wrongful death lawsuit will surely be filed by some aggressive plaintiff’s attorney, arguing to a jury that the landlord owns the ground, owns the trees coming out of the ground, and is simply trying to avoid the financial responsibility to thin and top dangerous trees.  

So my advice would be the following: (a) If you are in doubt about your legal responsibilities because the law is unclear, and (b) where doing nothing could place lives in danger, it is far better to undertake the financial responsibility of hazard pruning on a regular basis. In short, relying upon ORS 90.740(4)(h) when it comes to trimming and topping potentially dangerous trees, could be a serious and costly mistake.

"305","305","3","Phil Querin Q&A Community Owner Providing Tenant Association Information on Residents","Question.  A resident of our community has asked for a list of all the other residents’ names and addresses, so that she can contact them to set up a homeowners association.  While I don’t have an objection to the formation of a tenant association, I am concerned that giving out residents’ names and addresses might violate some tenant rights on our part.  Can you help?   

Answer:  ORS Chapter 90, the Oregon Residential Landlord Tenant Act, is replete with references to tenant associations. Residents clearly have many rights when it comes to the formation of an association, including the right of assembly and the right to canvass other residents. However, nowhere does the law say that park owners and managers have a legal duty to provide individual contact information to other residents, regardless of the purpose for which it is sought.

Here is what ORS 90.750 [“Right to assemble or canvass in facility; limitations”] says on the matter:

•	No park bylaw, rental agreement, regulation or rule shall infringe upon resident rights to:
o	Peaceably assemble in an open public meeting for any lawful purpose, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, in the common areas or recreational areas; reasonable times are the hours of 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.
o	To communicate or assemble among themselves, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, for the purpose of discussing any matter, including but not limited to any matter relating to the park, or manufactured dwelling living. 
•	The discussions may be held in the common areas or recreational areas of the facility, including halls or centers, or any resident’s home. 
•	However, the landlord may enforce reasonable rules and regulations including but not limited to place, scheduling, occupancy densities and utilities.
•	A landlord may not prohibit any resident from canvassing other persons in the same facility for certain prescribed purposes. The term “canvassing” includes door-to-door contact, an oral or written request, the distribution, circulation, posting or publication of a notice or newsletter, a general announcement or any other matter relevant to the membership of a tenants’ association. 
•	However, a landlord is not required to permit any person to solicit money, except that a tenants’ association member, whether or not a tenant of the facility, may personally collect delinquent dues owed by an existing member of a tenants’ association.
•	Lastly, the statute clarifies that it is not intended to require a landlord to permit any person to disregard a tenant’s request not to be canvassed. 

To me, this last provision suggests an answer to your question, as it acknowledges that some residents may not want to be “canvassed.”  In other words, they have certain rights not to be disturbed, and may request management’s assistance in preventing it from occurring.  

Accordingly, my view is that before contact information is shared by management with other residents, advance consent should be received from each affected person.  Without such consent, I would be very hesitant to give out the information.  Certainly, the resident seeking the contact information can try to obtain it by going door-to-door and asking for it.   

If community management already maintains a published directory of residents that contains names and addresses, I suppose consent is implied by the lapse of time, assuming that everyone knows of the directory.  But I would not recommend this practice, and certainly would not share the information with other residents.  

My conclusions are based not so much on some legal duty of “confidentiality” or legally protectable “right of privacy.” With the Internet, it’s hard to say much of our private information is legally protectable any more.  My feeling is a practical one: If there is no affirmative legal duty to provide the information, and there is some risk, however remote, that sharing it without advance consent could anger some residents, it is far better to decline your resident’s request. It does not hamper the association formation process in any way, and respects every resident’s privacy, however limited it is today.

1) Right to Pass Through Utilities. If the written rental agreement so provides, the landlord may require residents to pay a utility or service charge that has been billed by a utility or service provider to the resident for utility or service provided directly to the resident’s space.1 Subject to the policies of the utility or service provider, a landlord may, provide for utilities or services to tenants by one or more of the following billing methods:
￼￼
Where there is a relationship between the resident and the provider in which:
 The provider provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space,
including any utility or service line, and bills the tenant directly; and
 The landlord does not act as a provider.

 The provider provides the utility or service to the landlord;
 The landlord provides the utility or service directly to the resident’s space
(or common area); and
 The landlord:
• Includes the cost of the utility or service in the rent; or
• Bills the resident for the cost separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s
charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter.2 A relationship between the landlord, resident and provider in which:
 The provider provides the utility or service to the landlord;
 The landlord provides the utility or service directly to the resident’s
space; and
 The landlord uses a submeter to measure the utility or service actually
provided to the space and bills the resident for the amount provided.
•
￼1 The landlord is required to disclose to the tenant in writing at or before the commencement of the tenancy, any utility or service that the tenant pays directly to a utility or service provider that benefits, directly, the landlord or other tenants. This refers to common area utilities.
2 The apportionment method is of limited permissibility today.
• Exceptions:
 A landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment to bill
the resident for a utility or service charge separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter for:
• For garbage collection and disposal, unless the pro rata apportionment is based upon the number and size of the garbage receptacles used by the tenant
• For water service, if the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010
• For sewer service, if sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010.
 A landlord and resident may not amend a rental agreement to convert water or sewer utility and service cost in the resident’s rent to a method that bills the resident separately in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter.

2) Notice. To assess a resident for a utility or service charge for any billing period, the landlord shall give them a written notice stating the amount of the utility or service charge that the tenant is to pay the landlord and the due date for making the payment. The due date may not be less than 14 days from the date of service of the notice.

3) Utility or Service Charge is Not Rent or Fee. Nonpayment of a utility or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause by using a 30-day curable notice of termination.

4) Responsibility. The landlord is responsible for maintaining the utility or service system, including any submeter. After any installation or maintenance of the system on a resident’s space, the landlord shall restore the space to a condition that is the same as or better than the condition of the space before the installation or maintenance.

5) Water. A landlord may not assess a utility or service charge for water unless the water is provided to the landlord by a:
• Public utility as defined in ORS 757.0053;
• Municipal utility operating under ORS chapter 225;
• People’s utility district organized under ORS chapter 261; • Cooperative organized under ORS chapter 62;

The issue here is that the tree is located on neighboring land and not in our community.  The resident whose home was damaged had an arborist out to view the tree and said that the tree was a hazard.  What rights and responsibilities do we have in a situation like this?

Answer:   First, this is not an issue that is addressed – or can be addressed – in our “hazard tree” discussions that the MHCO has been having recently in the landlord-tenant coalition meetings.  This tree is not located in the park, so is not strictly a landlord “habitability” issue.  However, under certain circumstances it could be.

Clearly, community management does not have authority to cross over onto another’s land and cut down the tree – or even trim it.  However, if the branches of the tree extend into the community’s airspace, it may legally be trimmed by park management.  If it is feasible to do so, and done in a manner that is safe and responsible, it should be done.  Park management should consult an arborist before proceeding, in order to avoid trimming that could damage or injure the tree itself.  

Additionally, the property owner next door should be notified about the fallen limb.  This is for two reasons: (a) So the owner can secure his/her own expert advice on what to do to the tree to prevent a reoccurrence, and (b) to notify his/her insurance carrier. 

Whether the resident has a claim against the park owner is hard to tell without knowing more.  If the branch extended into the community and was believed to be a potential problem for some time, but ignored by management, then perhaps there is a claim.  But the stronger claim is likely against the owner of the tree itself, especially if it had not been properly cared for as a “hazard tree.”  If a claim is asserted against the park owner, he/she should bring a similar claim against the neighbor whose tree it was.  Then let the insurance carriers work it out.

The 2013 Oregon Legislative Session began earlier this month.   A number of proposals have been introduced that concern the manufactured housing community industry.

Landlord-Tenant Coalition Bill.  MHCO has been negotiating a landlord-tenant coalition bill since the end of the 2011 Legislative Session. In the end MHCO could not reach agreement on “Right of First Refusal” – a delay in the sale of a manufactured home community in order to let residents make an offer to purchase.  This proposal will be introduced as a separate piece of legislation, which MHCO will oppose.

Trees.  The coalition did reach agreement on some adjustment to the maintenance of trees on a space – allowing resident’s to hire a certified arborist to determine if a large tree is a hazard.  The resident has to pay for the initial hire to inspect a tree.  If the tree is deemed to be hazardous then the landlord will be required to pay for necessary maintenance.  Resident’s are still responsible for smaller trees, shrubs, and general space clean up.  A summary of the tree proposal has been prepared by Phil Querin and will be posted here in the next day or two.

MHCO tried to give as little away on this issue as possible, but unfortunately we are not working in a friendly landlord environment in this legislature.  Hence there was a need to make some compromises.

SAFE Act Exemption.  The second issue addressed in the coalition bill is a limited exemption from SAFE for community owners who sell homes in their community.  As currently drafted, community owners would have up to FIVE exemptions from the SAFE Act per year.  This will save close to $1200 per transaction.  MHCO is still working out the final details with the Department of Consumer and Business Services.  Once the law is passed MHCO will provide a complete analysis.

RENT CONTROL. Finally, another Rent Control Bill was introduced in the Senate on Thursday.  This proposal not only addresses rent control, but increases the state enforcement of Oregon Law in your manufactured home community.  This is perhaps one of the more onerous rent control proposals to come along in a couple sessions.  Need less to say MHCO will do everything to defeat this proposal.  

As we move forward this legislative session MHCO will keep you up to date on pending legislative issues.  Working together we are confident that we can defeat “right of first refusal” and rent control and whatever else pops up in the months ahead.

"325","325","1","Phil Querin Analysis of 2013 Legislative Proposal on Trees in Manufactured Home Communities","By  Phillip C. Querin, MHCO Legal Counsel 

Background. Oregon law addresses tenant responsibilities in ORS 90.740.  Currently, subsection (4)(h) says that except as provided in the rental agreement, it is the tenant’s responsibility to “(m)aintain, water and mow or prune any trees, shrubbery or grass on the rented space….”

Generally, most landlords and tenants have regarded this provision as meaning that trees located on a tenant’s space – regardless of size or condition – are the tenant’s sole responsibility. 

However, as a legal matter, notwithstanding the statute, a landlord could still be held liable for poorly maintained or dangerous trees that the landlord knows, or reasonably should know, are potentially dangerous.  While it may not be unreasonable to expect a tenant to engage in routine tree maintenance, e.g. pruning, trimming, watering, etc., it is likely unreasonable for a park owner to expect a tenant to incur the expense or personal safety of trimming or pruning large trees.  [And even if it is not unreasonable, there is legal risk to a landlord who ignores a dangerous tree on a tenant’s space, simply because the tenant has ignored it.]

As a result, MHCO, along with John VanLandingham, and the Landlord-Tenant Coalition, have reached agreement on a compromise bill that allocates responsibility between landlords and tenants for tree maintenance. 

Summary. What follows is a brief summary of the proposed legislation:

•	HABITABILITY
o	A rented space is considered uninhabitable if a landlord fails to maintain a “hazard tree.” 
 

•	DEFINITION OF A “HAZARD TREE”
o	One located on a rented space;
o	Measures at least 8 inches dbh ; and
o	Is considered by an International Society of Arboriculture-certified arborist as posing an unreasonable risk of causing serious physical harm or damage to persons or property in the near future.

•	DEFINITION OF “MAINTAINING” 
o	One that the responsible party (i.e. the landlord of tenant): 
•	Removes, trims or cuts, to eliminate those features of the tree that cause it be hazardous now - or may cause it to be hazardous in the future.  
•	Removing a tree includes cutting it down and removing the trunk, all branches, and the stump. 
o	Removal or major trimming of a tree of greater than 8 inches dbh must be done by a professional, licensed, bonded and insured tree service. 

•	TENANT RESPONSIBILITIES
o	Maintaining, at the tenant’s expense:
•	All non-hazard trees on the tenant’s space, and
•	All hazard trees planted by the tenant. 
o	Tenant maintenance and watering of trees on the rented space includes cleaning up, storing, or removing, any fallen leaves or branches – including hazard trees.
•	LANDLORD RESPONSIBILITIES
o	Unless the tree was planted by the current tenant, the landlord is responsible for maintaining a hazard tree on a rented space if the landlord knows, or should know, that the tree is a hazard tree.
o	A landlord has discretion in deciding whether the appropriate maintenance is removal or trimming of the hazard tree.
o	A landlord is not responsible for tree maintenance:
•	Of non-hazard trees, or
•	Maintaining any trees on the rent space for aesthetic purposes. 
o	A landlord may maintain any tree on a rented space in order to prevent the tree from becoming a hazard tree, after:
•	Providing reasonable written notice to the tenant, and
•	Allowing the tenant a reasonable opportunity to provide the needed maintenance at the tenant’s expense.

•	NOTICE TO TENANT FOR INSPECTION  OR MAINTENANCE 
o	The landlord must comply with the notice provisions of ORS 90.725 before entering a tenant’s space to inspect or maintain any tree.
o	A tenant may not deny a landlord permission to enter the space to inspect a tree, if the landlord:
•	Gives the tenant at least 24 hours’ actual notice, and
•	Inspection is at a reasonable time.
o	For purpose of emergency access to remove or trim a hazard tree (i.e. without giving 24 hours’ notice), an “emergency” includes the risk of serious damage or injury to the premises or persons. 
o	If a landlord has a report from a certified arborist that a tree on the tenant’s space is a hazard tree and must be removed or trimmed in order to remove its hazardous features, but is denied access, the landlord shall not be liable for any damage or injury as a result.

•	ARBORIST REPORTS
o	A tenant may retain, at their own expense, a certified arborist to inspect a tree on the tenant’s space.
o	If the arborist determines that the tree is a hazard, the tenant may either:
•	Remove the tree at the tenant’s expense, after providing the landlord with reasonable written notice of the proposed removal together with a copy of the arborist’s report; or
•	If the tree was not planted by the tenant and is the landlord’s responsibility, require the landlord to maintain the tree.   

•	MOVING OF MANUFACTURED DWELLINGS 
o	If home cannot be removed from a space without first removing or trimming a tree located on the space, the owner of the home may, at their own expense, remove or trim the tree before moving the home, after giving reasonable written notice to the landlord. 

•	MISCELLANEOUS
o	A landlord may unilaterally amend the Rental/Lease Agreement to implement this new tree trimming law.
o	The Statement of Policy shall include the park’s policy regarding the planting of trees on the rented space for a manufactured dwelling.

Background. Oregon law addresses tenant responsibilities in ORS 90.740.  Currently, subsection (4)(h) says that except as provided in the rental agreement, it is the tenant’s responsibility to “(m)aintain, water and mow or prune any trees, shrubbery or grass on the rented space….”

Generally, most landlords and tenants have regarded this provision as meaning that trees located on a tenant’s space – regardless of size or condition – are the tenant’s sole responsibility. 

However, as a legal matter, notwithstanding the statute, a landlord could still be held liable for poorly maintained or dangerous trees that the landlord knows, or reasonably should know, are potentially dangerous.  While it may not be unreasonable to expect a tenant to engage in routine tree maintenance, e.g. pruning, trimming, watering, etc., it is likely unreasonable for a park owner to expect a tenant to incur the expense or personal safety of trimming or pruning large trees.  [And even if it is not unreasonable, there is legal risk to a landlord who ignores a dangerous tree on a tenant’s space, simply because the tenant has ignored it.]

As a result, MHCO, along with John VanLandingham, and the Landlord-Tenant Coalition, have reached agreement on a compromise bill that allocates responsibility between landlords and tenants for tree maintenance. 

Summary. What follows is a brief summary of the proposed legislation:

•	HABITABILITY
o	A rented space is considered uninhabitable if a landlord fails to maintain a “hazard tree.” 
 

•	DEFINITION OF A “HAZARD TREE”
o	One located on a rented space;
o	Measures at least 8 inches dbh ; and
o	Is considered by an International Society of Arboriculture-certified arborist as posing an unreasonable risk of causing serious physical harm or damage to persons or property in the near future.

•	DEFINITION OF “MAINTAINING” 
o	One that the responsible party (i.e. the landlord of tenant): 
•	Removes, trims or cuts, to eliminate those features of the tree that cause it be hazardous now - or may cause it to be hazardous in the future.  
•	Removing a tree includes cutting it down and removing the trunk, all branches, and the stump. 
o	Removal or major trimming of a tree of greater than 8 inches dbh must be done by a professional, licensed, bonded and insured tree service. 

•	TENANT RESPONSIBILITIES
o	Maintaining, at the tenant’s expense:
•	All non-hazard trees on the tenant’s space, and
•	All hazard trees planted by the tenant. 
o	Tenant maintenance and watering of trees on the rented space includes cleaning up, storing, or removing, any fallen leaves or branches – including hazard trees.
•	LANDLORD RESPONSIBILITIES
o	Unless the tree was planted by the current tenant, the landlord is responsible for maintaining a hazard tree on a rented space if the landlord knows, or should know, that the tree is a hazard tree.
o	A landlord has discretion in deciding whether the appropriate maintenance is removal or trimming of the hazard tree.
o	A landlord is not responsible for tree maintenance:
•	Of non-hazard trees, or
•	Maintaining any trees on the rent space for aesthetic purposes. 
o	A landlord may maintain any tree on a rented space in order to prevent the tree from becoming a hazard tree, after:
•	Providing reasonable written notice to the tenant, and
•	Allowing the tenant a reasonable opportunity to provide the needed maintenance at the tenant’s expense.

•	NOTICE TO TENANT FOR INSPECTION  OR MAINTENANCE 
o	The landlord must comply with the notice provisions of ORS 90.725 before entering a tenant’s space to inspect or maintain any tree.
o	A tenant may not deny a landlord permission to enter the space to inspect a tree, if the landlord:
•	Gives the tenant at least 24 hours’ actual notice, and
•	Inspection is at a reasonable time.
o	For purpose of emergency access to remove or trim a hazard tree (i.e. without giving 24 hours’ notice), an “emergency” includes the risk of serious damage or injury to the premises or persons. 
o	If a landlord has a report from a certified arborist that a tree on the tenant’s space is a hazard tree and must be removed or trimmed in order to remove its hazardous features, but is denied access, the landlord shall not be liable for any damage or injury as a result.

•	ARBORIST REPORTS
o	A tenant may retain, at their own expense, a certified arborist to inspect a tree on the tenant’s space.
o	If the arborist determines that the tree is a hazard, the tenant may either:
•	Remove the tree at the tenant’s expense, after providing the landlord with reasonable written notice of the proposed removal together with a copy of the arborist’s report; or
•	If the tree was not planted by the tenant and is the landlord’s responsibility, require the landlord to maintain the tree.   

•	MOVING OF MANUFACTURED DWELLINGS 
o	If home cannot be removed from a space without first removing or trimming a tree located on the space, the owner of the home may, at their own expense, remove or trim the tree before moving the home, after giving reasonable written notice to the landlord. 

•	MISCELLANEOUS
o	A landlord may unilaterally amend the Rental/Lease Agreement to implement this new tree trimming law.
o	The Statement of Policy shall include the park’s policy regarding the planting of trees on the rented space for a manufactured dwelling.

 Answer:   This is a good – and important – question.  Here are some points to always remember:

1.	A resident who is renting the home is not under the manufactured housing section of Oregon’s residential landlord-tenant law (“ORLTA”) which is contained in ORS Chapter 90.  This means that you do not treat non-owner residents the same way you would as if they were renting an apartment or home.  Landlord and tenant rights, duties and remedies are different, depending upon whether the person renting the space also owns the home.

2.	A landlord’s remedies [e.g. for-cause termination, etc.] against a non-owner resident are found in ORS 90.392, 90.394, 90.396, 90.398, 90.403 and 90.405; they are not found in the manufactured housing section of ORLTA, which commences at ORS 90.505.   

3.	Similarly, you do not want to use a standard manufactured dwelling space rental agreement for a non-owner resident.  However, due to the number of park-owned homes, MHCO has developed a space rental agreement for tenants who do not own the home. You should use it.  If you use MHCO’s standard manufactured home space rental agreement for persons owning their home, you will be contractually giving the non-owner resident greater rights than you would otherwise need to do.  For example, the “cure period” for violations is much shorter for non-owner tenants – because they only need to vacate with their personal property.  They do not need to move a home.  If they owned the home, they would have a 30-day right to cure under ORS 90.630.  This means that you will have to use a different, non-MHCO form for rules violations by non-owner tenants. 

4.	However, the eviction process, i.e. the filing and service of an FED Complaint under ORS 105.105, et. seq, is the same.  That is, the process of the “first appearance,” trial settings, etc. is exactly the same. 

5.	Importantly, since the park owns the home, the park is the “landlord.”  This means that it must provide inside the home certain safety measures that ORLTA requires of landlords, such as smoke detectors and [if there is a carbon monoxide source] a carbon monoxide detector.  Some counties require a carbon monoxide detector in all cases, even if there is no carbon monoxide source, e.g. a gas fireplace.  Go to the State Fire Marshall’s site for more information on these important issues.

Manufactured homes are often clustered into manufactured home communities and in many areas of the country these communities have long faced considerable economic and regulatory impediments that can make expanding the supply of affordable housing more difficult for manufactured homes than for other types of housing. Resident-ownership of manufactured housing communities, or cooperatives (“Co-Ops”), are being promoted across the nation as a strategy for increasing affordable housing and as a way to increase the economic benefits of owning homes in manufactured housing communities.

Advocates of Co-Ops argue that resident-owned cooperative communities are an effective strategy for “preserving and improving affordable housing communities,” “building individual assets,” and “fostering, healthy, supportive communities,”1 but there is little evidence to date that suggests there are definitive benefits for the supply of affordable housing or the economic and financial well-being of cooperative owners beyond those that result from traditional, privately-owned communities. PolEcon completed and extensive research project on the impacts of Co-Ops in New Hampshire.2 Our 2008 research on the cooperative movement in NH used standard tools and methods of economic and housing market analysis and raised serious doubts about the claims of benefits made by advocates. Our report correctly pointed to the possible impacts that cooperatives would have on the supply of manufactured housing and raised concerns about the financial viability of highly leveraged cooperatives. We believe those concerns have been validated in the interim. In contrast, as the cooperative movement has been more broadly advocated across the nation, Co-Op advocates have yet to produce serious empirical research (that can be validated and replicated), that documents the impacts of Co-Ops on the supply of affordable, manufactured housing or the purported claims of economic and financial benefits that accrue to them.

Resident ownership of manufactured housing communities is an appealing story with appeal to many policymakers with real concerns about homeownership and the supply of affordable housing. Cooperatives have especially appeal to populists and believers in the greed and insensitivity of investors, owners, and landlords. Accurate or not, little of that would matter if cooperatives provided the affordable housing, economic, financial, and psychological benefits claimed by advocates. A proliferation of cooperatives is not an indication that they provide real economic, financial and housing benefits, however. Rather, it is an indication that advocates of cooperatives have assembled a combination of favorable financing, government subsidies, and supportive regulations that facilitate their growth. There are at lest four issues that should be considered by policymakers in considering the efficacy and desirability of proposals that facilitate or provide incentives for conversion of manufactured housing communities to resident- owned cooperatives:

Despite repeated attempts to obtain the data used in that analysis to verify findings PolEcon was unable to obtain the data or detailed methodologies to analyze it. This is highly unusual for university- affiliated research. A complete critique of that report and shortcomings of it limited economic analysis is included in PolEcon’s report “The Real Economic Impacts of Manufactured Housing Cooperatives” available on request.

•	What will be the potential long-run impact on the supply of manufactured and affordable housing? 
•	Will government and taxpayer subsidies be required to promote the cooperative model? 
•	What are the financial implications, on both cooperatives and home purchasers within them, of lending practices and underwriting standards that have been vilified as contributing to the recent housing crisis? 
•	Are there economic or financial gains for cooperatives and their homeowners above those realized in traditional, privately owned communities that would strongly warrant public subsidies?  Each of these issues is briefly discussed in this report. Psychological benefits to homeowners in cooperative also appear to be a primary benefit cited by advocates of cooperatives but they are less amenable to empirical investigation and outside of the expertise of PolEcon to evaluate.  

The Impact of Cooperatives on the Supply of Manufactured Housing  

Research on the supply of housing and its costs provides convincing evidence of how efforts to provide benefits to one group of citizens can have unintended and negative consequences for other citizens. The clearest and best example is rent control which is designed to make housing more affordable for some residents. Rent controls make rents more affordable for those residents in controlled units but evidence but an unintended consequence is that rents rise more rapidly in uncontrolled units and a reduction in overall housing investment (in part in response that new units may also someday become rent-controlled) also occurs.  There are several ways in which an increasing number of conversions to cooperatives could affect the supply of manufactured housing and ultimately impact the availability of affordable housing. 

		♦ €The primary sources of increased supply, developers and investors, may view the increase in Co-Ops as a sign of declining investment opportunities, a more hostile regulatory environment that minimizes returns on investment, or some other signal of a less favorable environment for expansion of manufactured housing and housing communities. The result would likely be a reduction in investments in manufactured housing, thus limiting a valuable source of affordable housing. 
		♦ €Similarly, owners and investors in manufactured housing communities may see a trend toward increased regulations and restrictions on their properties that reduce their economic value. 

In such a circumstance it is possible that more owners would look to convert their properties to alternate uses or hasten their conversions. In this case, the net number of new manufacture housing community units (the number of new units minus the number withdrawn) could decline or stagnate even as some new units or communities are being added.  Our 2008 research on housing trends in New Hampshire shows that the rapid rise in cooperative-ownership coincides with a decline in overall growth in manufactured housing units in pshire. As the number of housing units in communities increased dramatically this decade, the net increase in manufactured housing units fell dramatically.
The decline in net new manufactured housing units is not simply a function of a more general decline in new housing units in New Hampshire. The chart shows that in addition to the absolute declining trend in net new manufactured housing units, the percentage of new housing units in New Hampshire represented by manufactured housing also declined during the period of rapid increase in Co-Ops, falling from a high of about 12 percent in 1995 and 1996, to a low of under 3 percent by 2009.



Growth in Manufactured Housing is negatively related to the Presence of Co-Ops in a Town
Using more sophisticated, multivariate and econometric techniques, our 2009 research found that the presence of cooperatives in individual towns in New Hampshire was clearly related to slower growth in manufactured housing units compared to towns that had manufactured housing communities but no cooperatives. There are many more factors that influence the supply of manufactured housing but our results show a clear relationship between the presence of cooperatives in a community and slower growth in manufactured housing. These results were the first sophisticated attempt to empirically assess the impacts of Co-Ops on the supply of manufactured housing units. The results support some basic economic principles that suggest increasing barriers (or removing incentives) for private investment in an industry reduces the production or output in an industry.

Liberal Financing and Terms Produce Highly Leveraged Cooperatives and Homeowners

Establishing a cooperative requires both financial expertise and access to capital, two elements not typically available to residents of manufactured housing communities. Advocates of the cooperative movement promote cooperative ownership by supplying financial and management expertise and ready access to capital on extremely favorable terms that are not made available to investor-owned communities or to owners of manufactured homes in communities that do not have cooperative ownership. As advertised by ROC USA, these terms include financing 100% of the appraised value of communities.4 The NH Community Loan Fund has advertised mortgage financing for homes in co-ops up to 115% of appraised value in the past, although it is unclear if those terms are still available today. These types of “zero down payment,” low, or no equity, highly leveraged loans are widely thought to be a primary cause of the recent housing bubble and subsequent housing market crash and financial crisis in this country. Banks and mortgage companies were roundly criticized and subsequently subject to greater regulatory control as a result of making highly leveraged or zero down-payment loans.

The financial subsidies provided to Co-Op communities and homeowners should be assessed within the context of our understanding of the potential risks posed by highly leveraged real estate transactions. Our research in NH examined over 4,000 transactions in manufactured home communities in NH between 1999 and 2007. We found similar rates of foreclosure among homes in co-ops and investor-owned communities but that analysis was completed before the full impacts of the housing crisis occurred when the problems inherent in highly leveraged and zero equity mortgage loans were more likely to result in foreclosure than were less leveraged loans. Advocates Co-Ops, and of the liberal financing that allows residents to establish them, dismiss such concerns but to date but have not provided empirical data on the performance of the loans. Unlike financial institutions, the specialized organizations that arrange financing for cooperative conversions do not face the same reporting and regulatory requirements regulatory requirements as do most lenders. In essence, the performance of these loans is what cooperative advocates and their support organizations say they are. If they choose not to report a loan that is 90 days past due as in arrears, there is no publicly available mechanism (as there is with FDIC

4 See ROC USA http://www.rocusa.org/for-homeowners/financing.aspx .

quarterly bank “call reports” or credit union 5300 quarterly reports) to verify the performance and condition of their loans.
The number of emergency grants awarded to cooperatives previously documented in this report provides some indication of the financial position of many cooperatives and there have been several instances where board members of cooperatives have publicly stated their struggles to meet financial obligations.5
Although our research was conducted in 2008, during the beginning stages of the housing market crash and subsequent financial crisis, there was some evidence that greater forebearance was granted to delinquent mortgages in co-ops compared to mortgages in investor- owned properties. This likely occurred because the sources of financing (the NHCLF, ROC USA) and its partners and funders - foundations, tax credits, as well as banks as part of their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requirements were less compelled and under less scrutiny to enforce the provisions of these loans. In this circumstance, loans that traditionally perform more poorly (highly leveraged loans) in terms of default rates were more likely to be granted forbearance for delinquencies.

Promoting affordable housing and providing assistance to individuals in obtaining mortgages and purchasing homes are important and worthy public policy goals. However, the recent housing market crash and resulting financial crisis challenges the belief that public policies and public entities (think Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) or funds promoting that goal always have beneficial impacts. A clearer understanding of how cooperatives, homeowners in them fared during the recent housing crash should be required before public policies or funds are made widely available in promoting cooperatives. As we note in this report, over a period of just a few years, even a brief review of publicly funded housing grants revealed that 25% of cooperative in NH required some for of public subsidy for capital improvements.

The inherent subsidies given to Co-Ops (via favorable financing and direct grants for infrastructure investment from governmental, not-for-profit, and some private financial institutions, as well as greater forbearance in enforcing lending terms) can mask the financial difficulties encountered in the purchases of Co-Op communities or homes in a way that traditional communities cannot mask. It is relatively easy to increase the viability of cooperatives as long as financial institutions, and government and other grants are providing subsidies. Policymakers may, in fact, decide that such subsidies are desirable, and that promoting incentives for resident ownership are warranted but given the relatively high level of public subsidy they receive, it is may be more appropriate to call the resident and publicly-owned manufacturing housing communities rather than “resident-owned” communities.
 
 As an example the Medvil cooperative testified before a NH House committee looking at the issue of abandoned homes. Medvil board members indicated that they needed to be able to dispose of abandoned homes in their cooperative and rent those lots because their debt service was at 75% of revenues.
Resident-Owned Co-Ops Often Require Government Subsidies

Well-intentioned policies to support cooperatives often result in highly leveraged cooperative communities that may not be economically viable without substantial subsidies. Manufactured housing communities need periodic infrastructure improvements and investments. Lot rental fees in investor-owned communities must be high enough to build reserves or otherwise cover capital improvements in their communities. Community residents in investor owned parks can recognize the need for improvements but owners of communities are often criticized when lot fees are adjusted to cover these costs. Advocates of cooperatives often criticize owners of manufactured home communities for not making capital improvements and criticizing them for increasing rental fees when they do 
 
Advocates of cooperatives downplay the financial difficulties that confront cooperatives at the same time making it clear to potential cooperative owners that assistance in obtaining grant funding and subsidies will be made available. Cooperative owners face the same need to fund capital improvements (as well as other financial needs) as other communities. In NH, these needs have largely been met by obtaining public subsides in the form of government grants to fund inevitable capital improvements. Advocates thus argue for the benefits that “independence” that resident ownership and control may offer at the same time cooperative appear to increasingly rely on public subsidies for financial viability. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program in each state funded by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development agency and is one of the primary subsidies increasingly used by cooperatives in NH. Even an incomplete review of CDBG grant awards from the past 6 years6 shows that fully 25% of cooperatives in NH have obtained CDBG funding totaling more than $7 million.

The Economic Benefits of Cooperatives Have Not Been Empirically Demonstrated

There may be many reasons for promoting cooperatives, but results from our 2008 study, which used examined recorded deeds in over 4,000 manufactured homes sales in NH and which used an appropriate measures of economic gain (home price appreciation using a repeat-sales measure), showed that homes in Co-Ops do not offer the economic advantages over homes in traditional, privately-owned communities that are often cited by Co-Op advocates.

There is a vast literature in housing research that is applicable to Co-Ops. The various restrictions, etc. associated with Co-Ops function similar to more general land use and housing regulations. Regulations designed to benefit one group or homeowners or renters (in this case Co-Op homeowners) generally raise prices in the less regulated segment of the housing market. This has been near universally demonstrated with rent controls (a 1999 Fannie Mae study7 provides a solid review of the studies and evidence), but more generally research shows that housing restrictions and regulations of many types tend to increase prices in the “unrestricted” or “unregulated” segment of the market. Thus the proliferation of Co-Ops may be buoying appreciation of homes in traditional privately owned manufactured home communities in the same and neighboring towns.

		♦ €Our research indicates that the appreciation of homes in traditional privately owned communities exceeds that of homes in Co-Ops. o empirically valid measure has shown that homes in Co-Ops appreciate at a higher rate than do homes in traditional privately owned communities. A frequently cited (by Co-Op advocates) Consumer Union study measured appreciation using homeowner estimate of appreciation not actual market transactions and the NH Community Loan Fund study had no estimate of price appreciation but implied greater appreciation simply on the basis of initial sales price. 
		♦ €Both higher appreciation and higher volume of sales suggest that homes in traditional privately owned communities are in greater demand compared to homes in Co-Ops and are likely a more liquid asset than homes in Co-Ops (but neither should be considered a liquid asset).  6 Management of NH’s CDBG program has changed agencies (from NH Office of Energy and Planning to the Community Development Finance Agency) and previously available documents are not currently available on the Internet. 7 Early, D. W. and Phelps, J.T., “Rent Regulations’ Pricing Effect in the Uncontrolled Sector: An Empirical Investigation”, Journal of Housing Research, Vol 10, No. 2, 1999. 

Conclusions

Cooperative ownership of manufactured housing communities can provide benefits to residents, but it is important that these benefits not be promoted or subsidized in a manner that comes at the expense of the larger goal of increasing the supply of affordable housing options, or which increases the need for public subsidies and direct expenditures to accomplish these goals. To avoid potential unintended consequences, higher-quality research (than has been introduced thus far by advocates) on the impacts and implications of cooperative ownership of cooperatives is needed before policymakers embrace policies designed to facilitate them. The financial subsidies provided Co-Op communities and homeowners should be assessed within the context of our understanding of the potential dangers of high leverage learned from the recent housing and financial current crises. The inherent subsidies given to Co-Ops (via favorable financing and direct grants for infrastructure investment from governmental, not-for-profit, and some private financial institutions) can mask the financial difficulties encountered in the purchases of Co-Op communities or homes in a way that traditional communities cannot mask. Ultimately such risks may be warranted, but only if the benefits of cooperatives can be shown to clearly outweigh their risks of policies that promote them.

Advocates Co-Ops, and of the liberal financing that allows residents to establish them, dismiss such concerns but to date but have not provided empirical data on the performance of the loans. Unlike financial institutions, the specialized organizations that arrange financing for cooperative conversions do not face the same reporting and regulatory requirements regulatory requirements as do most lenders. In essence, the performance of these loans is what cooperative advocates and their support organizations say they are. If they choose not to report a loan that is 90 days past due as in arrears, there is no publicly available mechanism (as there is with FDIC

4 See ROC USA http://www.rocusa.org/for-homeowners/financing.aspx .

quarterly bank “call reports” or credit union 5300 quarterly reports) to verify the performance and condition of their loans.
The number of emergency grants awarded to cooperatives previously documented in this report provides some indication of the financial position of many cooperatives and there have been several instances where board members of cooperatives have publicly stated their struggles to meet financial obligations.5
Although our research was conducted in 2008, during the beginning stages of the housing market crash and subsequent financial crisis, there was some evidence that greater forebearance was granted to delinquent mortgages in co-ops compared to mortgages in investor- owned properties. This likely occurred because the sources of financing (the NHCLF, ROC USA) and its partners and funders - foundations, tax credits, as well as banks as part of their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requirements were less compelled and under less scrutiny to enforce the provisions of these loans. In this circumstance, loans that traditionally perform more poorly (highly leveraged loans) in terms of default rates were more likely to be granted forbearance for delinquencies.

Promoting affordable housing and providing assistance to individuals in obtaining mortgages and purchasing homes are important and worthy public policy goals. However, the recent housing market crash and resulting financial crisis challenges the belief that public policies and public entities (think Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) or funds promoting that goal always have beneficial impacts. A clearer understanding of how cooperatives, homeowners in them fared during the recent housing crash should be required before public policies or funds are made widely available in promoting cooperatives. As we note in this report, over a period of just a few years, even a brief review of publicly funded housing grants revealed that 25% of cooperative in NH required some for of public subsidy for capital improvements.

The inherent subsidies given to Co-Ops (via favorable financing and direct grants for infrastructure investment from governmental, not-for-profit, and some private financial institutions, as well as greater forbearance in enforcing lending terms) can mask the financial difficulties encountered in the purchases of Co-Op communities or homes in a way that traditional communities cannot mask. It is relatively easy to increase the viability of cooperatives as long as financial institutions, and government and other grants are providing subsidies. Policymakers may, in fact, decide that such subsidies are desirable, and that promoting incentives for resident ownership are warranted but given the relatively high level of public subsidy they receive, it is may be more appropriate to call the resident and publicly-owned manufacturing housing communities rather than “resident-owned” communities.
 
 As an example the Medvil cooperative testified before a NH House committee looking at the issue of abandoned homes. Medvil board members indicated that they needed to be able to dispose of abandoned homes in their cooperative and rent those lots because their debt service was at 75% of revenues.
Resident-Owned Co-Ops Often Require Government Subsidies

Well-intentioned policies to support cooperatives often result in highly leveraged cooperative communities that may not be economically viable without substantial subsidies. Manufactured housing communities need periodic infrastructure improvements and investments. Lot rental fees in investor-owned communities must be high enough to build reserves or otherwise cover capital improvements in their communities. Community residents in investor owned parks can recognize the need for improvements but owners of communities are often criticized when lot fees are adjusted to cover these costs. Advocates of cooperatives often criticize owners of manufactured home communities for not making capital improvements and criticizing them for increasing rental fees when they do 
 
Advocates of cooperatives downplay the financial difficulties that confront cooperatives at the same time making it clear to potential cooperative owners that assistance in obtaining grant funding and subsidies will be made available. Cooperative owners face the same need to fund capital improvements (as well as other financial needs) as other communities. In NH, these needs have largely been met by obtaining public subsides in the form of government grants to fund inevitable capital improvements. Advocates thus argue for the benefits that “independence” that resident ownership and control may offer at the same time cooperative appear to increasingly rely on public subsidies for financial viability. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program in each state funded by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development agency and is one of the primary subsidies increasingly used by cooperatives in NH. Even an incomplete review of CDBG grant awards from the past 6 years6 shows that fully 25% of cooperatives in NH have obtained CDBG funding totaling more than $7 million.

The Economic Benefits of Cooperatives Have Not Been Empirically Demonstrated

There may be many reasons for promoting cooperatives, but results from our 2008 study, which used examined recorded deeds in over 4,000 manufactured homes sales in NH and which used an appropriate measures of economic gain (home price appreciation using a repeat-sales measure), showed that homes in Co-Ops do not offer the economic advantages over homes in traditional, privately-owned communities that are often cited by Co-Op advocates.

There is a vast literature in housing research that is applicable to Co-Ops. The various restrictions, etc. associated with Co-Ops function similar to more general land use and housing regulations. Regulations designed to benefit one group or homeowners or renters (in this case Co-Op homeowners) generally raise prices in the less regulated segment of the housing market. This has been near universally demonstrated with rent controls (a 1999 Fannie Mae study7 provides a solid review of the studies and evidence), but more generally research shows that housing restrictions and regulations of many types tend to increase prices in the “unrestricted” or “unregulated” segment of the market. Thus the proliferation of Co-Ops may be buoying appreciation of homes in traditional privately owned manufactured home communities in the same and neighboring towns.

		♦ €Our research indicates that the appreciation of homes in traditional privately owned communities exceeds that of homes in Co-Ops. o empirically valid measure has shown that homes in Co-Ops appreciate at a higher rate than do homes in traditional privately owned communities. A frequently cited (by Co-Op advocates) Consumer Union study measured appreciation using homeowner estimate of appreciation not actual market transactions and the NH Community Loan Fund study had no estimate of price appreciation but implied greater appreciation simply on the basis of initial sales price. 
		♦ €Both higher appreciation and higher volume of sales suggest that homes in traditional privately owned communities are in greater demand compared to homes in Co-Ops and are likely a more liquid asset than homes in Co-Ops (but neither should be considered a liquid asset).  6 Management of NH’s CDBG program has changed agencies (from NH Office of Energy and Planning to the Community Development Finance Agency) and previously available documents are not currently available on the Internet. 7 Early, D. W. and Phelps, J.T., “Rent Regulations’ Pricing Effect in the Uncontrolled Sector: An Empirical Investigation”, Journal of Housing Research, Vol 10, No. 2, 1999. 

Conclusions

Cooperative ownership of manufactured housing communities can provide benefits to residents, but it is important that these benefits not be promoted or subsidized in a manner that comes at the expense of the larger goal of increasing the supply of affordable housing options, or which increases the need for public subsidies and direct expenditures to accomplish these goals. To avoid potential unintended consequences, higher-quality research (than has been introduced thus far by advocates) on the impacts and implications of cooperative ownership of cooperatives is needed before policymakers embrace policies designed to facilitate them. The financial subsidies provided Co-Op communities and homeowners should be assessed within the context of our understanding of the potential dangers of high leverage learned from the recent housing and financial current crises. The inherent subsidies given to Co-Ops (via favorable financing and direct grants for infrastructure investment from governmental, not-for-profit, and some private financial institutions) can mask the financial difficulties encountered in the purchases of Co-Op communities or homes in a way that traditional communities cannot mask. Ultimately such risks may be warranted, but only if the benefits of cooperatives can be shown to clearly outweigh their risks of policies that promote them.

"336","336","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Thirteen Year Old Boy Grows Up - Resident WIthout a Background Check","Question:  A family moves into a manufactured housing community with a thirteen year old boy.  Five years later the parents vacate the home but leave the boy who is now eighteen.  Even though the eighteen year old was never subject to a background check, never signed a rental agreement etc., is he now a considered a resident?

Answer:  This is an issue that the Oregon Residential Landlord Tenant Act (“ORLTA” or the “Act”) is not fully equipped to address. Nowhere in the Act is there a clear answer.  But connecting some dots, I think we can arrive at a logical answer.  

•	Technically, the 18-year old is not a tenant under the manufactured housing park (“MHP”) side of the Act, since he does not “own” the home.  At best, he is a “tenant” under the non-MHP side of the law – he could be considered a month-to-month tenant, and therefore subject to the 30-day right of termination by the landlord.  Assuming this, what is the landlord to do?  First, do the rules permit subleasing?  If not, he could be compelled to leave. 
•	Second, rent should not be accepted from him until this situation is clarified and a solution reached.
•	Third, if the landlord is willing to accept the 18-year old under these circumstances (i.e. assuming he goes into title), he could be offered a monthly tenancy, subject to his qualifying under the community rules, etc. which, of course, require the background check, etc.  
•	Lastly, again assuming the landlord is willing to accept him, a guarantee by the parents might be in order.  
•	Keep in mind that since he was not a signatory to the original rental agreement since he was a minor, the fact that he is the only person remaining at the home, technically makes him an authorized occupant that has not yet been approved by park management. This is your strongest card, and you should use it to fashion the solution that best fits your needs.

All of these things require some legal guidance, but the answer to the above question is that the landlord, by acting carefully, should be able to protect his position and either require the 18-year old to vacate or qualify in all respects as a new resident (assuming he goes into ownership of the home).  In all cases a background check is not only appropriate, but essential.

We put him under the Occupancy Agreement instead of permitting to become a tenant because his background check was sketchy.  They both work and they alternate paying the monthly rent.  Generally they do not create problems in the community and stay mostly by themselves.  However, recently the tenant and boyfriend broker up, but the tenant moved out leaving her boyfriend to continue paying the rent. How do I get the boyfriend out?

Answer: A temporary occupant is not supposed to be paying the rent.  You are not allowed to screen for the occupant’s ability to pay, because they are not a tenant.  Your acceptance of rent from the occupant creates an appearance that the occupant is really a tenant.  Secondly, the law says that a temporary occupant may not live in the home unless there is a tenant there as well.  Accordingly, if you accept rent from the temporary occupant in the absence of the tenant living there, it could create a situation where you have waived the temporary occupant status, and are now treating him as a full time tenant.
 
Here are the rules under the temporary occupancy statute ORS 90.275:
 
• The temporary occupant:
o Is not a tenant entitled to occupy the dwelling unit to the exclusion of others; and 
o Does not have the rights of a tenant.
• The temporary occupancy agreement may be terminated by:
o The tenant without cause at any time; and
o The landlord only for cause that is a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement.
• The temporary occupant does not have a right to cure a violation that causes a landlord to terminate the temporary occupancy agreement.
• Before entering into a temporary occupancy agreement, a landlord may screen the proposed temporary occupant for issues regarding conduct or for a criminal record. The landlord may not screen the proposed temporary occupant for credit history or income level.
• A temporary occupancy agreement:
o Must expressly include the above requirements;
o May provide that the temporary occupant is required to comply with any applicable rules for the premises; and
o May have a specific ending date.
• The landlord, tenant and temporary occupant may extend or renew a temporary occupancy agreement or may enter into a new temporary occupancy agreement.
• A landlord or tenant is not required to give the temporary occupant written notice of the termination of a temporary occupancy agreement.
• The temporary occupant shall promptly vacate the dwelling unit if a landlord terminates a temporary occupancy agreement for material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement or if the temporary occupancy agreement ends by its terms.
o Except in cases of discrimination (ORS 90.449) a landlord may terminate the tenancy of the tenant if the temporary occupant fails to promptly vacate or if the tenant materially violates the temporary occupancy agreement.
• A temporary occupant is treated as a squatter if they continue to occupy the home after a tenancy has ended or after the tenant revokes permission for the occupancy by terminating the temporary occupancy agreement.
• A landlord may not enter into a temporary occupancy agreement for the purpose of evading landlord responsibilities;
• A tenant may not become a temporary occupant in the tenant’s own dwelling unit;
• A tenancy may not consist solely of a temporary occupancy. Each tenancy must have at least one tenant.
 
In your case, it would appear that you could either terminate the tenant’s tenancy since they vacated leaving the temporary occupant to occupy alone, a violation of the statute, or terminate the temporary occupant for the same reason.  I would try a written notice to the temporary occupant, to see if they will voluntarily vacate.  If they refuse, then you should retain counsel and proceed to evict him as a squatter.  Do not, under any circumstances, accept rent from the temporary occupant.","Question: A tenant has her boyfriend living in her home under a MHCO Occupancy Agreement.",,"1370367280","2"

"341","341","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Converting Water Systems and Billing (Well Water to Public System)","Question:  Our community has been on well water forever. There is a new water system available to hook up to. Under that system each space would have its own meter and a flat rate would be charged for the first fixed number of gallons per space. After the fixed number of gallons/space is used, the homeowner would be charged a price per gallon. Can we charge exactly what the water system charges on top of the current rent?  Effectively passing on what we are charged for their individual use?

Answer:  For purpose of addressing this issue, I will assume that the community currently includes the operating costs for the well in the base rent, i.e. it is not a charge to residents outside of base rent that is allocated to them on a prorata (i.e. per space) basis.

Well water is not something you may separately charge the residents for under ORS 90.532.  There is no recognized method under Oregon law to recover it separately from – or outside of – base rent.  Since base rent may only be increased in accordance with the 90-day rent raise protocol described in ORS 90.600, there is no pass-through alternative for communities serviced by well water for drinking.  Subsection (8) of ORS 90.532 limits utility charges for water through the following means:

A landlord may not assess a utility or service charge for water unless the water is provided to the landlord by a:
      (a) Public utility as defined in ORS 757.005;
      (b) Municipal utility operating under ORS chapter 225;
      (c) People’s utility district organized under ORS chapter 261;
      (d) Cooperative organized under ORS chapter 62;
      (e) Domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264; or
      (f) Water improvement district organized under ORS chapter 552.
      (9) A landlord that provides utilities or services only to tenants of the landlord in compliance with this section and ORS 90.534 and 90.536 is not a public utility for purposes of ORS chapter 757.

Your question does not indicate whether the new water system falls into one of the above categories.  If it does, then you are entitled to assess a pass-through protocol, so long as the other submetering statutes are followed

What follows is brief summary of the applicable statutes.  As you will see, the issues are technical and complex.  In short, you should secure competent legal advice from an expert familiar with your particular situation.  This article or summary should not be relied upon to the exclusion of obtaining that legal advice.

•	90.532 This statute sets forth the permissible billing methods park owners may use for their water charges.

•	90.534 This statute describes how a landlord may charge for providing a utility or service directly to the residents’ spaces by apportionment of the costs per space.
•	90.536 This statute describes the use of submeters to each space and the appropriate billing method.

•	90.537 This statute instructs landlords on how and when they may convert from one billing method to another.

•	90.538 This statute describes the tenants’ rights to inspect billing records when an owner converts from one billing system to another.  In your case, since you are on well water, the only records I imagine you would have would be the well water maintenance costs, since there is no direct water charge to you.
 
•	90.539 This statute describes the park owner’s rights to access a resident’s space to read the submeter.  

Conclusion.  Without knowing more, it is hard to say definitively whether your proposed billing method [assuming the system is permissible under ORS 90.532(8)], would be allowed.  However, my guess is that it is not.  The reason is that the legislation and legislative history that resulted in these statutes is based upon much discussion and anecdotal experience.  The categories and protocols are very specific.  If you were to submeter, I suspect you could not “blend” your charges to include the equivalent of a fixed fee for everyone, with a metered rate for the higher users.  The concept behind submetering is that everyone pays for exactly what they use – no more, no less.  You proposed system does not appear to do that.

Additionally, I do not believe you may “convert” to this new system without making some downward adjustment in base rent, to account for the fact that the residents will no longer be using the well water – and therefore should no longer be paying the well maintenance cost.  [Of course, if the well water were converted to irrigation, that cost – already in the base rent - would seemingly be permissible.]

[Oregon SB 91]

By Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC MHCO Legal Counsel

Discussion: This Bill allows landlords to require tenants to maintain renter’s liability insurance, and describes the circumstances in which the landlord may consider whether an applicant has been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of a crime, or involved in an eviction proceeding. It also permits the landlord to retain a fee (if provided in the rental agreement) for certain repeat violations.

1. Tenant Liability Insurance [Note: This portion of the law does not apply to tenants in manufactured housing communities where tenant owns their own residence.]

• A landlord may require a tenant to obtain and maintain renter’s liability insurance

[Oregon House Bill 3482]
By Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC
MHCO Legal Counsel

Discussion:  Many manufactured housing communities in Oregon have large trees.  While Oregon law has imposed the duty of general tree maintenance on the residents, there is little question but that most do not have the expertise, skill or financial means to provide the type of maintenance that may be required for large older trees.  With this in mind, the MHCO encouraged the Landlord-Tenant Coalition to craft a bill that fairly and clearly allocated the responsibility for tree maintenance in a realistic manner.  Landlords are in a better position than residents to obtain and afford good liability insurance, since it is a standard cost of doing business.  Moreover, there was concern that under the existing law, some park owners might not regard the issue of tree maintenance as their problem.  In reality, however, it is.  Injury or death resulting from falling limb or tree that should have been trimmed or removed is surely going to result in potential liability to the park owner.  Accordingly, HB 3482 allocates the risk in a more realistic and practical manner:  Normal maintenance for trees on a resident’s space remains with the resident. However, if the tree has certain features that make it a “hazard tree” then responsibility shifts to the landlord – unless the resident planted the tree.  This delineation should help both landlords and residents understand their respective responsibilities.  

1.	Definitions.
•	“DBH”  means  the  diameter at  breast  height,   which is  measured   as the  width of  a standing tree  at  four  and  one-half feet  above  the  ground  on the  uphill side. 
 
•	“Hazard tree”  means  a tree  that:
o	Is located  on a rented space in  a manufactured dwelling park;
o	Measures  at  least  eight  inches  DBH;  and
o	Is  considered, by  an  arborist licensed  as a  landscape  construction professional pursuant  to ORS  671.560 and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture, to pose an unreasonable risk  of causing  serious  physical  harm  or  damage  to individuals or  property in the  near  future.

2.	Habitability.  A rented space is considered uninhabitable if the landlord does not  maintain a hazard tree required by the 2013 Act. 
 
3.	Resident Duties re Trees Located on Space.  A resident  shall maintain and water trees, including cleanup and removal of fallen branches  and leaves, on the  rented space for  a manufactured dwelling except  for  hazard trees. 
•	“Maintaining a  tree”  means removing or  trimming a  tree  for  the  purpose  of eliminating features of the  tree  that  cause the  tree  to  be hazardous, or  that  may  cause  the  tree to become hazardous in  the  near  future. 

•	“Removing a tree”  includes:
o	Felling and  removing the  tree;  and 
o	Grinding or removing the stump of the tree.

4.	Landlord Duties re Hazard Trees. 
•	Landlord shall maintain a hazard tree that  was not  planted by the  current resident if the landlord knows  or should know that  the  tree  is a hazard tree;

•	Landlord may  maintain a tree  on the  rented space to prevent the  tree  from  becoming  a hazard tree;
o	Must provide residents with reasonable written notice and reasonable opportunity to maintain the tree themselves.

•	Landlord has discretion to decide whether the appropriate maintenance of a hazard tree is removal or trimming.

•	Landlord is not responsible for:
o	Maintaining a tree that is not a hazard tree; or
o	Maintaining any tree for aesthetic purposes.

•	A landlord must comply with the access provisions of ORS 90.725 before entering a resident’s space to inspect or maintain a tree. [Generally, 24-hour notice. – PCQ]

•	Subject to the preceding, a resident is responsible for maintaining the non-hazard trees on the resident’s space at the resident’s expense.  
o	The  resident may  retain an  arborist licensed  as a landscape  construction professional pursuant to ORS 671.560 and certified by the International Society  of Arboriculture to inspect a tree  on  the  resident’s  space  at  the  resident’s  expense;

Discussion:  Many manufactured housing communities in Oregon have large trees.  While Oregon law has imposed the duty of general tree maintenance on the residents, there is little question but that most do not have the expertise, skill or financial means to provide the type of maintenance that may be required for large older trees.  With this in mind, the MHCO encouraged the Landlord-Tenant Coalition to craft a bill that fairly and clearly allocated the responsibility for tree maintenance in a realistic manner.  Landlords are in a better position than residents to obtain and afford good liability insurance, since it is a standard cost of doing business.  Moreover, there was concern that under the existing law, some park owners might not regard the issue of tree maintenance as their problem.  In reality, however, it is.  Injury or death resulting from falling limb or tree that should have been trimmed or removed is surely going to result in potential liability to the park owner.  Accordingly, HB 3482 allocates the risk in a more realistic and practical manner:  Normal maintenance for trees on a resident’s space remains with the resident. However, if the tree has certain features that make it a “hazard tree” then responsibility shifts to the landlord – unless the resident planted the tree.  This delineation should help both landlords and residents understand their respective responsibilities.  

1.	Definitions.
•	“DBH”  means  the  diameter at  breast  height,   which is  measured   as the  width of  a standing tree  at  four  and  one-half feet  above  the  ground  on the  uphill side. 
 
•	“Hazard tree”  means  a tree  that:
o	Is located  on a rented space in  a manufactured dwelling park;
o	Measures  at  least  eight  inches  DBH;  and
o	Is  considered, by  an  arborist licensed  as a  landscape  construction professional pursuant  to ORS  671.560 and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture, to pose an unreasonable risk  of causing  serious  physical  harm  or  damage  to individuals or  property in the  near  future.

2.	Habitability.  A rented space is considered uninhabitable if the landlord does not  maintain a hazard tree required by the 2013 Act. 
 
3.	Resident Duties re Trees Located on Space.  A resident  shall maintain and water trees, including cleanup and removal of fallen branches  and leaves, on the  rented space for  a manufactured dwelling except  for  hazard trees. 
•	“Maintaining a  tree”  means removing or  trimming a  tree  for  the  purpose  of eliminating features of the  tree  that  cause the  tree  to  be hazardous, or  that  may  cause  the  tree to become hazardous in  the  near  future. 
•	“Removing a tree”  includes:
o	Felling and  removing the  tree;  and 
o	Grinding or removing the stump of the tree.

4.	Landlord Duties re Hazard Trees. 
•	Landlord shall maintain a hazard tree that  was not  planted by the  current resident if the landlord knows  or should know that  the  tree  is a hazard tree;
•	Landlord may  maintain a tree  on the  rented space to prevent the  tree  from  becoming  a hazard tree;
o	Must provide residents with reasonable written notice and reasonable opportunity to maintain the tree themselves.
•	Landlord has discretion to decide whether the appropriate maintenance of a hazard tree is removal or trimming.
•	Landlord is not responsible for:
o	Maintaining a tree that is not a hazard tree; or
o	Maintaining any tree for aesthetic purposes.
•	A landlord must comply with the access provisions of ORS 90.725 before entering a resident’s space to inspect or maintain a tree. [Generally, 24-hour notice. – PCQ]
•	Subject to the preceding, a resident is responsible for maintaining the non-hazard trees on the resident’s space at the resident’s expense.  
o	The  resident may  retain an  arborist licensed  as a landscape  construction professional pursuant to ORS 671.560 and certified by the International Society  of Arboriculture to inspect a tree  on  the  resident’s  space  at  the  resident’s  expense;
o	If  the  arborist determines that  the  tree  is a hazard, the  resident may:
•	Require the  landlord to  maintain the tree  as a hazard tree;  or
•	Maintain the  tree  at  the  resident’s  expense,  after providing the  landlord with reasonable  written notice  of the  proposed  maintenance and  a copy of the  arborist’s report.

5.	Tree Obstructing Removal of Home From Space. If a manufactured home cannot  be removed  from  a space without first  removing or  trimming a  tree  on  the  space,  the  owner   of  the  home may  remove  or trim the  tree  at  the  owner’s  expense,  after giving  reasonable written  notice  to the landlord, for  the  purpose  of removing the  home.


 
6.	Use  of Landscape Professional.  The  landlord or  resident that   is  responsible  for  maintaining  a  tree   must  engage  a landscape  construction professional with  a  valid  landscape license  issued  pursuant to  ORS  671.560  to maintain any  tree  with a DBH  of eight  inches  or  more.

7.	 Access to Resident’s Space [ORS 90.725].
•	An “emergency” includes  but  is not  limited  to:
o	A repair problem that, unless  remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious  physical  harm  or damage  to individuals or property;
o	The presence of a hazard tree on a rented space in a manufactured dwelling park.
•	An “unreasonable time”  refers  to a time  of day,  day  of the  week  or  particular time  that conflicts  with the  resident’s  reasonable and  specific  plans  to use the  space. 
•	 “Yard   maintenance,  equipment  servicing  or  grounds   keeping” includes,   but  is  not limited to, servicing individual septic  tank  systems or  water pumps,  weeding, mowing grass and  pruning trees  and  shrubs.
•	A  landlord   or  a  landlord’s   agent  may  enter  onto  a  rented  space to:
o	Inspect or  maintain trees;
o	A  landlord or  the  landlord’s agent may  enter  a rented space solely  to  inspect  a tree  despite  a denial of consent  by the  resident if  the  landlord or the  landlord’s agent  has given  at least  24 hours’  actual notice  of the  intent to enter  to inspect  the  tree  and  the  entry occurs  at  a reasonable time. 
o	If a landlord has a report from  an  arborist licensed  as a landscape  construction professional  pursuant to ORS 671.560 and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture that  a tree  on the  rented space is a hazard tree  that  must  be maintained by the  landlord under this Act, the  landlord is not  liable  for  any  damage  or injury as a result  of the  hazard tree  if  the  landlord is unable  to gain  entry after making a good faith effort  to do so.

"357","357","3","Phil Querin Q&A Resident Builds Carport - Sells Home - New Owner Wants to Take Home and Carport","Question: I have a resident who was given permission to build a permanent carport.  Most all of the carports in my park are free standing and permanent which is my preference. However, he constructed the permanent carport by boring holes in the ground and filling them with concrete and inserting metal mounts to which he fastened 4x4 uprights for the carport.  Building it this way, in my opinion, made it part of the real property.  I was there when construction started but was absent when it was completed. 

What now complicates matters is that he recently decided to sell the manufactured home, including the carport.  This would not have been an issue had the buyer is now planned on moving the home.  I believe that since the carport is now permanently affixed to the ground, it cannot be sold as personal property along with the home.  He also attached the carport to the manufactured home which may complicate things, as well.  What are my rights here?

Answer:  This situation is not directly addressed in the Oregon manufactured housing laws.  First, some general observations: The manufactured housing side of the landlord-tenant law regards the “space” as the “premises.”  For example, a resident in an apartment may not, without landlord permission, intentionally make major structural changes to the interior of the premises. However, most apartments have rules against this, or it is included in the rental agreement. Your space agreement or rules may have similar prohibitions regarding major changes to the space.

In this case, however, you permitted the work to commence.  It is unclear whether you had reviewed any plans, before the work started.  You should have made this a condition of building the carport in the first place.  What about permits?  It is unclear whether they are required in your jurisdiction, but it is something you should always make sure is complied with.  

I am unclear what you mean when you say that other such structures are “free standing and permanent.”  If they are permanent, in the sense of being permanently affixed to the space, then presumably, you are treating these as structures that would remain if the home were sold and removed.  However, your independent conclusion that a structure is “permanent” and therefor stays with the space is really not the complete issue; what does the resident believe?  It was his money that presumably paid for the work, and he may have some say in whether he intended it to be a part of the home, and movable if the time came.  

While your opinion is important, so is that of your resident.  For this reason, I suggest that before doing this again, you might consider addressing it in the community rules.  Some of the things that should be covered are the following:

•	Code compliance
•	Management pre-approval of completed drawings
•	Time to complete work
•	Your right to post a notice of non-responsibility for liens if the resident hires a contractor
•	Method of affixing to the ground
•	Safety of final structure and perhaps inspector sign-off
•	Who owns the structure
•	Can it be removed upon sale and removal of the home (I suggest “yes” so long as the space is returned to its original condition and all holes are safely and completed filled, etc.)
•	Duty to keep the carport in good and safe condition – remember if it is a part of the space, absent agreement with the resident, it would be your duty, since you own the park.
In this particular case, I suggest that if you have not pre-addressed these issues with your resident, he may believe this is his structure to do with as he sees fit.  I really can’t disagree, since you permitted the project and from your question, it appears no ground rules were established regarding ownership in the event the home was moved. However, if you permit the carport structure to be removed, you should insist that the space be returned to its original pre-construction condition.  That’s about the best you can do with this situation, although establishing rules – or at least agreed-upon terms – before construction commences again, is a good idea.

The community owner blames the resident and hires an exterminator.  Can the exterminator enter the house?  What kind of notice would be required? Can the landlord force the resident to pay for the extermination? 

Answer:  Since the tenant does not own the home, the answer is found on the general landlord-tenant side of ORS Chapter 90 (as opposed to the manufactured housing side).  Here is a summary of the tenant duties under ORS 90.325:

•	Use the parts of the premises including the living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and dining room in a reasonable manner considering the purposes for which they were designed and intended.

•	Keep all areas of the premises under control of the tenant in every part as clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin, as the condition of the premises permits and to the extent that the tenant is responsible for causing the problem. The tenant shall cooperate to a reasonable extent in assisting the landlord in any reasonable effort to remedy the problem.

•	Dispose from the dwelling unit all ashes, garbage, rubbish and other waste in a clean, safe and legal manner. With regard to needles, syringes and other infectious waste, as defined in ORS 459.386, the tenant may not dispose of these items by placing them in garbage receptacles or in any other place or manner except as authorized by state and local governmental agencies.

•	Keep all plumbing fixtures in the dwelling unit or used by the tenant as clean as their condition permits.

•	Use in a reasonable manner all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and other facilities and appliances including elevators in the premises.

•	Test at least once every six months and replace batteries as needed in any smoke alarm, smoke detector or carbon monoxide alarm provided by the landlord and notify the landlord in writing of any operating deficiencies.

•	Behave and require other persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave in a manner that will not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors.

The underscored portion above clearly applies. The next question is the right of access.  That is covered in ORS 90.322.  The statute is quite long and complicated.  Here is a summary of the relevant portions applicable to your situation:

•	A landlord or, to the extent provided in this section, a landlord’s agent may enter into the tenant’s dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under the tenant’s exclusive control in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, perform agreed yard maintenance or grounds keeping or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workers or contractors. The right of access of the landlord or landlord’s agent is limited as follows:
•	In case of an emergency, a landlord may enter the dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant’s exclusive control without consent of the tenant, without notice to the tenant and at any time. “Emergency” includes but is not limited to a repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious damage to the premises. If a landlord makes an emergency entry in the tenant’s absence, the landlord shall give the tenant actual notice within 24 hours after the entry, and the notice shall include the fact of the entry, the date and time of the entry, the nature of the emergency and the names of the persons who entered.
 
•	If the tenant requests repairs or maintenance in writing, the landlord or landlord’s agent, without further notice, may enter upon demand, in the tenant’s absence or without the tenant’s consent, for the purpose of making the requested repairs until the repairs are completed. The tenant’s written request may specify allowable times. Otherwise, the entry must be at a reasonable time. The authorization to enter provided by the tenant’s written request expires after seven days, unless the repairs are in progress and the landlord or landlord’s agent is making a reasonable effort to complete the repairs in a timely manner. If the person entering to do the repairs is not the landlord, upon request of the tenant, the person must show the tenant written evidence from the landlord authorizing that person to act for the landlord in making the repairs.
      
•	A landlord may not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. A tenant may not unreasonably withhold consent from the landlord to enter.

•	If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access or may terminate the rental agreement under ORS 90.392 and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. In addition, the landlord may recover actual damages.

You have two choices in this situation: (a) Declare an emergency and enter to remediate the problem, carefully following the provisions of the access statute; (b) Try to secure the tenant’s consent to have an exterminator enter and remediate the problem; (c) Terminate the tenancy and then fix the problem. Note that if you seek consent and the tenant refuses, you cannot then enter under the emergency provisions of the law, since the tenant has already refused access.  

As for damages, yes you can recover the cost, assuming that the exterminator confirms that this was a tenant caused problem.

"359","359","1","Legislative Update:  MHCO Pushes Back SAFE Regulations for Oregon Community Owners","OREGON’S SAFE ACT EXEMPTION FOR PARK OWNERS
[Oregon HB 3482 – Landlord-Tenant Coalition Bill]
By Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC MHCO Legal Counsel

Discussion: Manufactured park owners have for several years struggled to keep their communities occupied by owners of homes [as opposed to renters of homes]. Home ownership is good for everyone, and is reflected in better care of the home and space, pride of ownership, and community involvement that does not necessarily occur when homes are filled with renters. For these reasons, many parks require that homes be owner-occupied. Oregon's abandonment law requires that the landlord be primarily responsible for the disposition of abandoned homes. This has placed a significant financial burden, including increased liability, on landlords who are now required to go through the byzantine, costly, and time consuming abandonment process imposed by ORS 90.675, which consists of approximately five pages of statutory procedures - from the mailing of letters to multiple parties, to advertising and conducting a private sale.

In many cases, it is the landlord who ends up being saddled with the home, when there are no higher bidders at the private sale. When they recover possession of homes either though a completed abandonment or through pre-abandonment when the tenant voluntarily waives their right to the home under ORS 90.675(22)(e), landlords are faced with one of two alternatives:

 Give the home away to a charity or non-profit;
 Dismantle and/or remove the home, or
 Sell it to a person who wants to become a resident in the community.
Reselling the home to a potential tenant is clearly the best choice, as it provides an affordable housing option to people who might not otherwise have one. In many cases, tenants cannot afford institutional financing for such a purchase, or the lender will simply not make the loan since it is personal property. Landlord-carried financing provides potential residents with the opportunity to become home owners. Furthermore, purchasing a home may be a tenant’s only chance to live in the community if the rules require owner-occupancy.

Oregon’s Limited Dealer License Law. In order to make these types of on-site sales, park owners must have a dealer’s license under ORS 446.691 or a limited dealer’s license under ORS 446.706. This statute governing limited dealer licenses, which most park owners hold if they are selling formerly abandoned homes, provides the following:

 The home must have been abandoned at a manufactured dwelling park.
 If the home was not subject to sale under the private auction provisions of the abandonment law, the dealer must have the certificate of title or registration for
the dwelling transferred to them before offering it for sale; or 1
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
 The home must have been purchased by the park owner from a person holding title, and at the time of purchase by the park owner, it was sited in the community identified in the park owner’s license.
 If the park owner sells the home that was abandoned at a park other than the park where it is being sold, the sale terms must require that it be sited at the park where it is being sold for at least 12 months following the sale.

The limited license arose out of the need for park owners to legally make the occasional sale of abandoned or pre-abandoned homes in order to keep in [or bring into] the community. The limited license requirement provides DCBS regulatory oversight, and is not an unduly burdensome requirement for park owners.

The SAFE Act’s Regulatory Scheme. Since the enactment of the federal SAFE Act and its Oregon counterpart found in ORS Chapter 86A, the Oregon Division of Finance and Corporate Securities (“DFCS”) has interpreted these laws to apply to the occasional on-site sales by park owners under their limited licenses. They have reached this conclusion primarily because there is ostensibly a ""credit decision"" made by the park owner when entering into an installment contract sale with a tenant. This means that under Oregon law, park owners operating under a limited license had one of two choices:

 Either become licensed as a Mortgage Broker or Mortgage Loan Originator (""MLO""); or
 Contract with an existing MLO who works for an independent Mortgage Broker - at a reported cost of $1,400+ or more to the park owner, and ultimately to the home buyer.
The New Statutory Exemption. MHCO worked extensively with DFCS and others to develop an exemption to the Oregon law that would permit park owners to engage in the sale of formerly abandoned homes to purchasers for the purpose of a primary residence without having to use a MLO. Here is a summary of the new exemption law which will be found in ORS 86A.203. It applies to:

• One who is licensed as a manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.691.
o May offer or negotiate terms of a residential mortgage loan related to a sale for occupancy of a previously owned manufactured dwelling in a park, three or fewer
times in a 12 month period;
o A written sale agreement must be used that complies with certain requirements, or
with DFCS rules1.
o The person may not hold more than eight residential mortgage loans without
securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1). [Presumably, this means “at one time.”]
1 The statute cited to for compliance, ORS 646A.052, et. seq. is antiquated and inadequate for residential housing today. Presumably, the DFCS will have to create a suitable form through rulemaking.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼2
• One who is licensed as a limited manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.706.
o May offer or negotiate terms of a residential mortgage loan related to a sale for occupancy of a previously owned manufactured dwelling in a park, five or fewer
times in a 12 month period:
o They must have an ownership interest in a manufactured dwelling park;
o A written sale agreement must be used that complies with certain requirements, or
with DFCS rules.
o The person may not hold more than twelve residential mortgage loans without
securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1). [Presumably, this means “at one time.”]

On July 26, 1990, President Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""), The Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (the “1991 Regulations"") were shortly thereafter developed to guide new construction and alterations undertaken by covered entities and established the minimum requirements for ""accessibility"" for disabled persons in buildings and facilities and in transportation vehicles. After more than twenty years, the Department of Justice implemented new regulations, which became mandatory in 2012 (the “2012 Regulations.”) Your state may have passed parallel laws, which could increase the protection of individuals with disabilities, e.g., the Unruh Act in California. However, this article focuses on Federal ADA compliance. Keep in mind that the ADA is a civil rights law, which addresses a number of subjects, but this article focuses on ac- cessibility (no longer called “handicap”) issues only.

A mobile home park owner might ask, ""How about my pre-exist- ing park, does it need to comply with ADA issues?"" Answer: ""It de- pends."" If your mobile home park pre-dates the ADA statute, and the Park has not gone through any significant renovations (deter- mined on a case-by-case basis), then the park may be ""grandfathered in"" in most cases. However, there can still be considerations of ""reasonable accommodation"" and ""readily achievable barrier removal"" under the ADA that could require a park owner to make modifications to existing structures and to make existing buildings ""accessible"" to the disabled. There may be no ""grandfathering in"" under these provisions of the ADA. In addition, if the park has undergone sub- stantial alterations/renovations, this could also trigger ADA com- pliance. A mobile home park owner might also ask “If my park needs to comply with ADA issues, then does the park have to comply with the 1991 Regulations or the 2012 Regulations?” Once again, the answer is “it depends.” There is a broad “grandfather” clause that exempts all building elements constructed in compliance with the 1991 Regulations until those elements are subject to a planned alteration.

So--is a mobile home park a ""place of public accommodation"" or not? The ADA defines a ""public accommodation"" to be ""a private entity that owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation."" Examples of places of ""public accommodation"" include places of lodging; establishments serving food or drink; places of exhibition or entertainment; places of public gathering; sales or rental establishments; service establishments; stations used for public transportation; places of public display or collection; places of public recreation; places of public education; social service center establishments; and places of exercise or recreation. Does a mobile home park fit within these descriptions? Based on discussions with ADA experts,the typical mobile home park does not appear to ""fit"" under any of the enumerated examples of a ""public accommodation,"" assuming the park's facilities are only open for the sole use and enjoyment of the park's residents, rather than the ""general public."" In some cases, however, a park's clubhouse and office could be determined to be ""public accommodations"" as they are generally ""opened to the pub- lic."" In addition, the park's office is necessarily ""opened to the pub- lic"" as persons, not otherwise residents of the park, are allowed in and, in fact, are invited in to inquire about available spaces and/or mobile homes in the park. One issue which has been “rearing its ugly head” recently in connection with what are referred to as “drive-by” ADA lawsuits is the inadvertent conversion of a “non-public” ac- commodation to a “public” accommodation. For example, if the park clubhouse is not open to the general public, but the park allows the clubhouse to be used as a polling station for elections, or for classes for the local college, or for swimming lessons in the pool, the park may have inadvertently converted the area to a “public” accommodation and will be required to comply with the ADA for the impacted area, e.g., pool or clubhouse. Even the “innocent” re- quest by one person to use the “private” restroom at the management office could trigger thousands of dollars in improvements to make the restroom “accessible”.

If the park has ""public accommodations"" which have ""barriers"" to ""access,"" then the next consideration is whether the ""removal of the barrier"" is ""readily achievable."" Remember that these barriers apply to all sorts of disabilities, including sight and hearing, and not just accessibility for wheel chairs. The ADA generally defines ""readily achievable"" as easily accomplished and able to be carried out with- out much difficulty or expense. 42 U.S.C.S. § 12181(9). Federal courts have developed several factors in determining what is ""readily achievable"": (1) nature and cost of the removal; (2) overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved; (3) number of persons employed at such facility; (4) effect on expenses and re- sources; (5) impact of such action upon the operation of the facility; (6) overall financial resources of the covered entity; (7) overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees; (8) the number, type, and location of its facilities; (9) type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including com- position, structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity; and (10) geographic separateness, administrative or fiscal relation- ship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity. Col- orado Cross Disability Coalition v. Hermanson Family Ltd. Pshp. The park however will bear the ultimate burden to prove that the barrier removal is not readily achievable. This will be determined on a case- by-case basis for each individual park. The 1991 Regulations pro- vide examples of steps that may be “readily achievable” according to the Department of Justice.

So, how do you lessen the chance of your park becoming a ""tar- get"" of an ADA lawsuit? There are no ""bright lines"" as to whether a park has ADA issues or not. Since an ""ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"" the prudent park owner might be best served by hiring a knowledgeable ADA Consultant to review and comment on whether the park has any ADA issues and how they should or could be addressed. California has implemented a Certified Access Specialist (“CASp”) training and licensing program, which provides incentives (i.e., some protections from lawsuits) for property owners who conduct a CASP inspection. Another, and more conservative approach would be to simply make sure that all of the park facilities are ""ADA compliant,"" even if, technically and legally, you may not be required to do so. Little things can make a big difference in your park. Examples of ADA compliance include: levers on the entrance doors; levers on bathroom doors and fixtures; bathroom fixtures at proper height; proper bathroom accessories; doorways that accept wheelchair access; bathrooms that accept wheelchair access; counters at correct height for wheelchairs users; alternatives (ramps/elevators) to steps into the clubhouse and office; acceptable transitions (no lips) at doorways (interior and exterior); accessible parking and van access spaces; acceptable transitions (commonly referred to as ""curb cuts"") to sidewalks at street junctions and accessible parking; and acceptable inclines from parking areas to the park’s “public accommodations,” to name a few.

Your ADA consultant can walk your park and let you know what facilities do and do not comply with ADA. Making the necessary improvements will be money well spent, and potentially ""ward off' ex- pensive litigation, which litigation, in all probability, will not be covered by your general liability insurance policy. You might also want to turn this into a ""PR plus"" for your park - i.e., tell your res- idents about the improvements after they are done! However, such actions may not be right for every park. The park owner should first discuss ADA considerations with its legal counsel to determine what the right course of action is under the particular circumstances.

In addition, insurance is playing an ever more important role in protection against ADA claims. More and more often, ADA plain- tiff lawyers are adding causes of action for negligence and alleging bodily injury to trigger the potential for coverage under the park owners CGL policies. Our recommendation is to tender any ADA claims to your carrier immediately. In addition, some insurers now offer what is known as “tenant discrimination” insurance, which may pro- tect the park owner in the event of an ADA claim since the ADA claim is a civil rights claim. We suggest all park owners speak with their industry insurance broker about possible insurance protection.

"377","377","3","Phil Querin Q&A Home Reseller Paying Fees to Employees of Another Company","Question: Is it legal for a manufactured home reseller to pay referral fees to employees of another company who are not working under the reseller’s specific dealers license?


Answer: I cannot find any law precisely on point, so will have to “reason by analogy.” For purposes of answering the question, I will assume that the payor and the payee both have an Oregon manufactured structures dealer’s (“MSD”) license. However, that license only permits one to conduct business from a single location. If a person wanted to conduct business elsewhere, they would need to have a supplemental license (Form 440-2963).  See, statutes here. 

My concern with the payment of referral fees between separate dealers, is that it blurs the distinction between the “single location” requirement.  In other words, the payee would be receiving compensation from his own business location and another (unrelated) business location as well.  I would not be too concerned if the two locations where owned by the same person or entity, but if not, there could be regulatory problems with the responsible agency, Finance & Corporate Securities Division (“DFCS”).

Legally, there could  be additional ramifications.  Say the recipient of the fee made a misrepresentation to the customer, or there was a material defect in the home that resulted in injuries. If litigation ensued, the plaintiff would have two potential targets rather than one.  

Under the Oregon real estate licensing laws, one broker may pay a referral fee to another broker associated with an unrelated company.  However, this is expressly permitted by statute.  I see nothing in the statutes allowing MSDs to engage in referral fee activity, so would not recommend it without first checking with the DFCS.

Article provided by Kathleen Landau, Accounting Manager for Commonwealth Real Estate Services since 2009.  Kathleen brings over 20 years of accounting experience and knowledge to the Commonwealth team, and as a multi-site property owner herself, understands the unique needs facing property investors and small business owners.

###

So before I give you another accounting rule we are enforcing, let me say the goal is to protect your investment! We live in a very litigious society and need to be aware of potential risks and ways to protect our assets.   Commonwealth employees are insured through workers' compensation policies and also provided regular training regarding workplace safety.   Another area we are striving to improve risk management and compliance is in the area of hiring contractors. When a contractor is hired, the onsite manager must obtain verification that the contractor is licensed, bonded, and insured. In addition, a Form W-9 must be provided for purposes of reporting non-employee compensation on a Form 1099-Misc at the end of the year. 

The downturn in the economy resulted in many contractors allowing their insurance and licensing to lapse. We are currently working on two projects to confirm all contractors are still in compliance. The first will be a ""preferred vendor"" list by location. Commonwealth is compiling lists by geographic areas of approved vendors so in an emergency situation your onsite manager or regional manager knows what vendors have up-to-date information on file. Secondly, we will be combining this vendor list with our accounting program to alert us when we need to update the insurance information.  The reason to remind our customers of this policy is that some may have ""tried and true"" contractors that would not be eligible to work at the communities unless they can provide the necessary information requested OR become an employee to complete the task you wish to hire them for. I mention the latter as it is a legal remedy to tackling some of the small jobs that may be better served by hiring specialized temporary employees through agencies. Another option is hiring an individual on a task by task basis for their special skill. Commonwealth wants to be sure we are doing our best to protect your investment by limiting your risk exposure, both legal and financial, associated with contractors working at your communities.

Another reminder is that we do send 1099-Misc forms to all contractors annually. The form 1099-Misc reports all non-employee compensation. Amounts paid for employee compensation are reported on a Form W-2. Employees cannot receive a 1099-Misc and Form W-2 from the same employer for similar work. In order to keep away from any proof of control issues, our company policy is to send a W-2 to all employees and make sure all compensation for that individual runs through payroll. All independent contractor payments are reported on a 1099-Misc.

"398","398","3","Phil Querin Q&A Ground Under Home Settles - Resident Wants Ground Leveled Under Home","Question: One of my tenants has approached me asking if I would pay to have her mobile leveled.  It appears the ground underneath her mobile is settling and the concrete pad has cracked.  She indicated that she is worried about the water lines to her home.  She has lived in the park for 30 years, and is a former manager approaching 80 years of age. What is my responsibility for leveling mobile homes in the park, even if caused by the ground subsiding? 


Answer: Normally, per the park rules, leveling is a resident responsibility at the commencement of the tenancy. However, here you may have a habitability issue.  Here is what the statute says:

90.730 (Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition.) provides: 
      (2) A landlord who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home shall at all times during the tenancy maintain the rented space, vacant spaces in the facility and the facility common areas in a habitable condition. The landlord does not have a duty to maintain a dwelling or home. A landlord’s habitability duty under this section includes only the matters described in subsections (3) to (5) of this section.
      (3) For purposes of this section, a rented space is considered unhabitable if it substantially lacks:
      (e) At the time of commencement of the rental agreement, buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin;”

This would seem to suggest that from a habitability standpoint, as long as the pad was in good shape at the commencement of the tenancy, you no longer have any further duty to the resident. I think that conclusion would be a mistake. 

By your question, it sounds as if your elderly resident is concerned about her water lines.  Leveling it could prevent this damage.  If the condition of the pad was due to the resident’s improper use, that’s one thing.  But here, it’s due to the condition of the ground that you rented to her.  She has no right to “fix” the ground as it’s not hers to fix. 

Inasmuch as you own the ground, and the ground is causing the problem, I would suggest that leveling is your responsibility.  If the problem was not the result of the ground, I would say it is the resident’s responsibility.  Look at it this way:  If you do nothing, and her water lines break, she will have a damage claim against you.  If you level it, that risk is greatly reduced if not eliminated. If you do pay to the have leveling done, make sure that someone checks the water lines under the home, just to make sure they have not been damaged by the cracking in the pad.  

There is a greater question as to whether the pad itself needs to be fixed.  Leveling the home may be just a temporary fix if the problem continues.

"399","399","3","Phil Querin Q&A Resident Convicted of Sex Crime Is Released From Jail. What Can Be Done To Prevent This?","Question: A tenant was convicted of a sex crime - molesting his granddaughters.  He will be released from jail shortly.  His wife is living in our community, but her name is not on the rental agreement, just her husband's. His intentions are to resume living with his wife in our 55+ Park.  What can we do to prevent his return?

Answer: I assume when he was first accepted as a resident he did not have a criminal record for any sex offenses. The statute that comes into play is ORS 90.630 (Termination by landlord; causes; notice; cure; repeated nonpayment of rent.)  It provides, in part: 

“ ... the landlord may terminate a rental agreement that is a month-to-month or fixed term tenancy for space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home by giving to the tenant not less than 30 days’ notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination if the tenant:
      (c) Is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587;”

This statute has only been in existence for a few years.  As I read it, assuming that at the commencement of the tenancy, a landlord ran a criminal background check on a prospective resident and nothing showed him to be a sex offender – and they he later committed a sexual offence – you can evict them at as soon as you find out.  

In this case, it would seem that you can exclude him on that basis alone.  Had this law been on the books when he committed the crime, and he didn’t go to jail, you could have evicted him at the time. Now that it’s on the books, I think you have the same right to keep him out, i.e. to protect the residents’ visiting grandchildren.     

The only issue is whether he is “…a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587.”    Here is what those statutes say, and I imagine you will have to verify whether he falls into one of the categories.    

181.585 “Predatory sex offender” defined; determination. (1) For purposes of ORS 181.585 to 181.587, a person is a predatory sex offender if the person exhibits characteristics showing a tendency to victimize or injure others and has been convicted of a sex crime listed in ORS 181.594 (5)(a) to (d), has been convicted of attempting to commit one of those crimes or has been found guilty except for insanity of one of those crimes.
      (2) In determining whether a person is a predatory sex offender, an agency shall use a sex offender risk assessment scale approved by the Department of Corrections or a community corrections agency. [Formerly 181.507; 1997 c.538 §10; 2005 c.567 §16; 2009 c.713 §14]
 
81.586 Notice to appropriate persons of supervised predatory sex offender; content; additional duties of supervising agency. (1)(a) If the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision for a person on parole or post-prison supervision or the Department of Corrections or a community corrections agency for a person on probation makes a determination that the person under its supervision is a predatory sex offender, the agency supervising the person shall notify:
      (A) Anyone whom the agency determines is appropriate that the person is a predatory sex offender; and
      (B) A long term care facility, as defined in ORS 442.015, or a residential care facility, as defined in ORS 443.400, that the person is a predatory sex offender if the agency knows that the person is seeking admission to the facility.
      (b) When a predatory sex offender has been subsequently convicted of another crime and is on supervision for that crime, the agency supervising the person, regardless of the nature of the crime for which the person is being supervised:
      (A) May notify anyone whom the agency determines is appropriate that the person is a predatory sex offender; and
      (B) Shall notify a long term care facility, as defined in ORS 442.015, or a residential care facility, as defined in ORS 443.400, that the person is a predatory sex offender if the agency knows that the person is seeking admission to the facility.
      (2) In making a determination under subsection (1) of this section, the agency shall consider notifying:
      (a) The person’s family;
      (b) The person’s sponsor;
      (c) Residential neighbors and churches, community parks, schools, convenience stores, businesses and other places that children or other potential victims may frequent; and
      (d) Any prior victim of the offender.
      (3) When an agency determines that notification is necessary, the agency may use any method of communication that the agency determines is appropriate. The notification:
      (a) May include, but is not limited to, distribution of the following information:
      (A) The person’s name and address;
      (B) A physical description of the person including, but not limited to, the person’s age, height, weight and eye and hair color;
      (C) The type of vehicle that the person is known to drive;
      (D) Any conditions or restrictions upon the person’s probation, parole, post-prison supervision or conditional release;
      (E) A description of the person’s primary and secondary targets;
      (F) A description of the person’s method of offense;
      (G) A current photograph of the person; and
      (H) The name or telephone number of the person’s parole and probation officer.
      (b) Shall include, if the notification is required under subsection (1)(a)(B) or (b)(B) of this section, the information described in paragraph (a)(D), (F) and (H) of this subsection.
      (4) Not later than 10 days after making its determination that a person is a predatory sex offender, the agency supervising the person shall:
      (a) Notify the Department of State Police of the person’s status as a predatory sex offender;
      (b) Enter into the Law Enforcement Data System the fact that the person is a predatory sex offender; and
      (c) Send to the Department of State Police, by electronic or other means, all of the information listed in subsection (3) of this section that is available.
      (5) When the Department of State Police receives information regarding a person under subsection (4) of this section, the Department of State Police, upon request, may make the information available to the public.
      (6) Upon termination of its supervision of a person determined to be a predatory sex offender, the agency supervising the person shall:
      (a) Notify the Department of State Police:
      (A) Of the person’s status as a predatory sex offender;
      (B) Whether the agency made a notification regarding the person under this section; and
      (C) Of the person’s level of supervision immediately prior to termination of supervision; and
      (b) Send to the Department of State Police, by electronic or other means, the documents relied upon in determining that the person is a predatory sex offender and in establishing the person’s level of supervision.
      (7) The agency supervising a person determined to be a predatory sex offender shall verify the residence address of the person every 90 days. [Formerly 181.508; 1997 c.538 §11; 1999 c.626 §10; 1999 c.843 §2; amendments by 1999 c.626 §33 and 1999 c.843 §3 repealed by 2001 c.884 §1; 2001 c.884 §11; 2005 c.671 §11]
 
 181.587 Availability of information on supervised predatory sex offender. (1) Unless the agency determines that release of the information would substantially interfere with the treatment or rehabilitation of the supervised person, an agency that supervises a predatory sex offender shall make any information regarding the person that the agency determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the information listed in ORS 181.586 (3), available to any other person upon request.
      (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the agency shall make the information listed in ORS 181.586 (3), or any other information regarding the supervised person that the agency determines is appropriate, available to any other person upon request if the person under supervision:
      (a) Is a predatory sex offender; and
      (b) Is neglecting to take treatment or participate in rehabilitation. [Formerly 181.509]


MHCO Note:  The law regarding the eviction of sexual predators was championed by MHCO several years ago.  Through MHCO's efforts in the Landlord-Tenant Coalition, MHCO was able to change Oregon Statutes to give Landlords in manufactured home communities the right to evict an existing resident in a community who is discovered to be a predatory sex offender.

Following is an article by King County Office of Civil Rights.  While written with Washington state laws in mind, it is none-the-less relevant and instructive for housing providers across our service area of Oregon and SW Washington.  

Occupancy standards are common in rental housing and are particularly applicable for private and professional landlords.  However, we also, on occasion, see occupancy standards in condo and homeowners’ associations, as well as in manufactured home park settings making the following germane to all kinds of housing providers.  

If you have a question about your rights or responsibilities under federal, state, or local fair housing laws, please visit us at www.FHCO.org or call our free Hotline at 800/424-3247 Ext. 2.

Have you heard that it's okay to limit occupancy to two persons per bedroom?  Think again! 
The ubiquitous two-per-bedroom occupancy standard is a very general guideline provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development – IT IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE!  Fair housing enforcement agencies review a number of factors to determine whether an occupancy standard is overly restrictive.  Establishing a two-per-bedroom standard without making a determination of its reasonableness for the specific unit may not protect you from a finding that the standard is overly restrictive.  <In fact, we here at the FHCO have seen a growing body of case law across the country where housing providers with simplistic, across the board two-per-bedroom policies are losing disparate impact cases.>

When a housing provider limits the number of occupants in a unit, it impacts families with children more severely than families without children.  <It is illegal to deny housing to families with children simply because of the presence of children under 18 in the household under the Fair Housing Act  and a occupancy policy that specifies the number of children verses people is a violation of the law.  Restrictive occupancy standards can also have a disproportionate impact on some ethnic groups that, culturally and statistically have larger households.  This may be due to more children than the current US norm or because of multigenerational families sharing the same living space.  Therefore, two-per-bedroom policies may have an illegal, disparate impact on these households too, based on the basis of race, color, national origin, or religion.>  

Under fair housing laws, housing providers can set reasonable occupancy standards that are based on business needs; however, the adverse effect of these standards on various protected classes requires that the housing provider justify the use of such standards.  Each situation presents a unique set of facts.

HUD utilizes guidance from the ""Keating Memo"" (available at www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm), which considers a variety of factors, including the size and design of the bedrooms and the unit, the unit configuration, other physical limitations of the housing, the age of the children, and other relevant factors. HUD's guidance notes that if a dwelling is governed by State or local governmental occupancy requirements, and the housing provider’s occupancy policies reflect those requirements, HUD considers the governmental requirements as a special circumstance tending to indicate that the housing provider’s occupancy policies are reasonable. 

As a housing provider, knowledge of occupancy standards can assist you in making reasonable business decisions in compliance with the fair housing laws.  Here's what to do if you choose to establish an occupancy standard:
1) Measure! Get out the measuring tape and measure the rooms in your units – specifically the dimensions for each bedroom, living room, extra room, library, den, home office, or other room that may be used as a ""sleeping space.""  It helps to develop a floorplan that clearly illustrates the size and configuration of the unit.

2) Find the applicable code!  Find out which local zoning or building occupancy limitations (if any) apply to your unit, house, apartment complex or community.  Apply this occupancy guideline to your units based on each unit's specific size and configuration determined in #1 above – the resulting number of occupants the applicable guideline allows is the basis for your occupancy standard!

3) Be prepared to substantiate business-related factors!  If there are issues such as the age or condition of your dwelling and its accompanying systems (sewer, septic, electric, water, etc.) which require a more restrictive occupancy standard, be prepared to establish a clear relationship between the business-related factor and the occupancy standard.  For example, if a septic system has a limited capacity, be prepared to substantiate that factor by a statement from someone capable of making that determination.  Also, be prepared to show whether you looked at other ways to address a limited septic system that do not require a restrictive occupancy standard such as installing water-saving devices or more frequent pumping of the system.

Additional factors could be relevant in evaluating an occupancy standard case.  For example, the enforcement agency may need to determine whether the occupancy standard is applied to the number of people or the number of children occupying a unit. <The latter is specifically illegal.  Any occupancy standard you may have should indicate the number of people allowed; never the number of children allowed.>  The enforcement agency may also look at whether there is a history of ""adults only"" rules, segregation of families, or rules directed only at children. Overall, the fair housing agency will determine whether there is any other information that supports or refutes the allegation that the occupancy standard is being used to bar or limit children <or other protected class, such as ethnicity> from occupancy.

Civil rights enforcement agencies work to protect the civil rights of all regardless of protected class status.  They also have a responsibility to assist housing providers to make reasonable business decisions that are in compliance with fair housing laws.  Each case presents a unique set of facts and is determined on a case-by-case basis; however, housing providers who establish occupancy standards based on the above criteria will have a head start.

For many years we at the FHCO have suggested a more conservative 2+1 recommendation (two-people-per-bedroom plus one extra person for the unit).  We have not seen housing providers get in trouble for a 2+1 policy.  Given the growing body of case law around simplistic two-per-bedroom policies, we recommend this standard all the more strongly.  Better yet, as the article above details, an occupancy policy should be unique to each unit or style of floorplan and be born out of a robust analysis of all the factors hinted at in the Keating Memo.  Additional case law suggests that including young children (under two years of age) as a person for the total body count of occupants is also problematic and we do not recommend it.  

We suggest that housing providers think about the individual size of the dwelling and not adopt a blanket standard for all units. If the unit or the bedrooms are particularly large, you should consider even more liberal occupancy standards than you would otherwise.

A further word of caution:  while the Keating Memo references the age of children, housing providers should use the utmost of caution and seek legal council before setting an occupancy policy that focuses on the age, beyond the recommendation to not count children under two years of age.  In addition, it is not the purview of housing providers to predetermine who shall sleep in which rooms or with whom within an unit.  These considerations are up to each individual family; not something that may be dictated by housing providers.

"402","402","3","Phil Querin Q&A Accepting Application When You Suspect Applicant Does Not Qualify.","Question: I recently received a rental application from a prospective tenant who is purchasing another tenant's home.  I know the applicant to have several judgments against him.  He says they have all been taken care of but I don't believe him.  I really don't want to spend time processing the application.  Do I have to accept and process the application? 

Answer:   A judgment is a lien on all real property that is owned by the judgment debtor in the county in which the debtor resides.  The lien gives the judgment creditor the right to “execute” on that real property, i.e. force a sale of the property with the proceeds being applied toward payment of the judgment. It is good for ten years and can be renewed for another ten years.  If the creditor doesn’t know if the debtor owns property in a particular county he can record the judgment there anyway (or some counties or every county in Oregon), and it will immediately attach if property is located there. This means that if the debtor attempts to dispose of, or mortgage, the property, the  judgment lien will prevent the transaction until the creditor is paid in full.  Judgments carry interest at 9% per annum. 

If the judgment debtor does not own any real property to which the lien can attach, he can still try to get paid, either through garnishment of wages or bank accounts, or execution upon other of the debtor’s assets. If the creditor doesn’t know what assets the debtor has, he can subpoena him into court, place him under oath, and ask questions about the existence and whereabouts of the debtor’s assets.

As you can see, armed with a recorded judgment, a creditor can make a debtor’s life somewhat unpleasant. Once the judgment is satisfied, the debtor should insist that the creditor remove the lien by recording a Satisfaction of Judgment.  This has the effect of nullifying the judgment and it will no longer appear as a negative comment on his credit history.  

In your case, you should tell the person that as long as the judgments appear on the record, it will appear on his credit report, affect his credit score,  and could interfere with his ability to qualify to rent a space in your community. If,  indeed, the liens have been taken care of, he needs to have the judgment creditors each record a Satisfaction of Judgment. 

A word of caution: ORS 90.680(6)(b) says that a landlord may not unreasonably reject a tenant’s prospective purchaser.  My concern here is that if you reject the purchaser before running the background check, you face a potential claim from the existing tenant that your rejection in advance, was per se´ unreasonable. Furthermore, if the applicant is a member of a protected class, you could be setting yourself up for a fair housing claim. 

Please consider this:  If these are old judgments or very small amounts, they may say little about his qualifications as a tenant.  It may be that no collection efforts are being made. Most collection agencies do not want to spend a lot of time chasing small sums, or if they do, they will discount the amount for a cash payment. How recent are the judgments? Is he gainfully employed? How long has he been employed?  What is his debt-to-income ratio?  His rental history?  How is he paying for the home?  If you don’t know the answer to these questions, perhaps you should consider running the report just to find out. Since he is paying the cost of the credit check, completing the process may be your best and safest course of action, rather than “assuming” it’s as bad as you think because of the unsatisfied judgments.  It is far easier to say “No” after the credit, criminal, and background checks, because – if you’re right – you’ll have something to base the rejection on.  Rejecting him in advance gives you no such safe harbor protection.

"422","422","3","Phil Querin Q&A Selling a home in your park acquired through abandonment without having to hire a mortgage broker.  Can you explain the new law?","Question: I understand that today I may sell a home our park acquired back in an abandonment without having to hire a mortgage broker. Can you explain the new law?

Answer:  I assume you are referring to a sale where you carry back the security obligation (as opposed to the buyer paying cash or securing third party financing).  In this respect, you are correct, subject to several limitations. MHCO worked extensively with the Oregon Department of Finance and Corporate Securities (“DFCS”) and others to develop an exemption to the Oregon law that would permit park owners to engage in the sale of formerly abandoned homes to purchasers for the purpose of a primary residence without having to use a broker (referred to as a “Mortgage Loan Originator” or “MLO” under the new law).  Here is a summary of the new exemption law which will be found in ORS 86A.203.  

•	Here are the rules for those licensed as a manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.691.
o	They may offer or negotiate the terms of the loan three or fewer times in a 12 month period;
o	They must use a written sale agreement that complies with certain requirements, or with DFCS rules .
o	The dealer may not hold more than eight residential mortgage loans without securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1). [Presumably, this means “at one time.”] 

•	Here are the rules for those licensed as a limited manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.706.
o	They may offer or negotiate terms of the loan five or fewer times in a 12 month period:
o	They must have an ownership interest in a manufactured dwelling park; 
o	They must use a written sale agreement that complies with certain requirements, or with DFCS rules.
o	They may not hold more than twelve residential mortgage loans without securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1).  [Presumably, this means “at one time.”]

But here’s the rest of the story: Just because you are exempted from the MLO licensing requirements for a limited number of sales, does not mean that you are free from the tentacles of the Dodd-Frank Act. No, indeed.  In fact, there are two new rules that still will apply. 
1.	Ability-to-Repay (“ATR”) Rules.  A creditor is prohibited from making a residential loan (this includes your sale of the formerly abandoned home) unless it first makes “…a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for “qualified mortgages.” [See CFPB Summary, here.]

In complying with the ATR rules, you must consider and verify the following borrower information:
a)	Current or reasonably expected income or assets [other than the value of the home that secures the loan];
b)	Current employment status;
c)	Monthly payment on the mortgage loan;
d)	Monthly payment on any simultaneous mortgage loan that the creditor knows or has reason to know will be made;
e)	Monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations [e.g., insurance, taxes, assessments];
f)	Current debt obligations;
g)	Monthly debt-to-income ratio, or residual income; and
h)	Credit history.

In making the loan you will be required to calculate the mortgage loan payment based on:
•	The fully indexed rate or any introductory interest rate (whichever is greater); and
•	Substantially equal monthly installment that will fully amortize the loan amount over the loan term.

At first blush, perhaps these requirements don’t seem so burdensome, since one would think any smart lender would follow these protocols anyway. But remember, back in the easy money days, lenders were not keeping most of their loans on their own books; instead, the loans were “securitized”, i.e. bundled and sold as securities to investors all over the world.  This meant that circa 2004 – 2008, the originating banks that funded these residential loans were quickly repaid by investors and were never going to have to deal with them if and when they failed. Hence, bank underwriting was virtually nonexistent back then – except, of course, for those loans the banks were going to keep on their own books (sometimes referred to as ""portfolio loans"").

2.	Qualified Mortgages.  The Dodd-Frank Act has established a term, “Qualified Mortgage,” or “QM,” that provides a safe harbor for lenders.  That is, if the loan is a QM, there is a legal presumption that the lender complied with the ATR underwriting rules, and therefore the penalties for non-compliance are either eliminated or substantially reduced, as discussed below.  If a presumption is “conclusive,” no amount of evidence to the contrary will defeat it.  But if a presumption is “rebuttable,” the party opposing the presumption has an opportunity to rebut it by introducing evidence to the contrary.

For a mortgage to be a “Qualified Mortgage,” it must meet the following requirements:
•	All of the “Non-Traditional” Loan Features Must be Removed – This refers to features that we saw in the past, e.g. negative amortization, interest-only payments, and certain balloon payments.[5]
•	The loan may not exceed 30 years.
•	If the loan is for $100,000 or more, it cannot have points or fees greater than 3% of the total loan amount.  There are different and stricter limits for smaller loans. Certain “bona fide discount points” for prime loans are not included in these limits.
•	There is an Income Verification and Monthly Debt-to-Income Ratio Cap; The borrower’s total monthly debt-to-income ratio (i.e. all housing and non-housing expenses, such as food, automobile, child care, etc.) can be no greater than 43%. 
•	Monthly payments must be based on the highest payment that will apply during the first five years of the loan.
The presumptions afforded to lenders making QM loans gives lender protection as follows:
•	Safe Harbor QM loans – Conclusive Presumption. These are prime loans that (a) Meet the ATR compliance rules including the underwriting requirements above; (b) Are secured by a first lien on the residence; and (c) Carry an interest rate that is less than 1.5% higher than the average prime rate available.[7] The presumption of ATR compliance is conclusive. It is a complete safe harbor.
•	Higher-Priced QM Loans – Rebuttable Presumption. Here, the presumption of ATR compliance is rebuttable. These loans include first-position liens with an interest rate of equal to or greater than 1.5% over the available prime rate.  Essentially, these loans are “higher priced” because the borrowers’ credit is less than prime, i.e. the loan is, in the vernacular, “sub-prime.”

Noncompliance with the ATR Rules. Violations of the ATR rules are harsh, and likely to stifle any types of loans that hint of non-compliance. If a material violation is established, the borrower would have the ability to recover back all of the finance charges and fees paid, plus actual damages, statutory damages, attorney fees and court costs.  The plaintiff’s bar and the class action bar must be sharpening their knives. There is a three year statute of limitations from the date the violation occurred. 

Conclusion.  I marvel at the complexity of these laws which have been implemented to “protect” consumers by confusing creditors – especially small creditors, such as park owners selling formerly abandoned homes to fill a space and provide affordable housing.  If these small transactions caused the credit and housing crisis of 2008 and the ensuing Great Recession, perhaps I could understand.  But they didn’t. What we’re are seeing is a huge net of bureaucratic regulation that has been cast over even the smallest of transactions under the guise of consumer protection.

Going forward into 2014, my suggestion is for park owners to decide if: (a) They want to handle these transactions without the use of a MLO (which will add several hundred dollars to each sale) or (b) Go it alone, with knowledge that they will still be expected to comply with the ATR and QM rules. If the latter, my suggestion is to create the simplest of paper transactions, with a market rate interest, no adjustable rates, and a balloon that is not less than five years.

He met our screening criteria and we sent a letter indicating that he had been accepted.  The applicant lives out of town and started sending rent checks but did not sign the rental agreement.  There were also repairs that we indicated to him that he needed to make before he could move in.  At this point he has title to the home, refuses to sign the rental agreement and we refuse to cash his checks.  What should we do?


Answer:   First and foremost, send the checks back as soon as they come in.  Do not hold onto them, as there is Oregon case law saying that doing so for an unreasonable amount of time can constitute acceptance.  Include a letter with the checks reiterating what you told him about the necessity of the repairs and the need to sign the rental agreement.  I hope the nature of the repairs and the amount of time he has to complete them are a part of the rental agreement.  IF not they should be.  The only real way to enforce this requirement is to make the repairs a written condition of the tenancy.   Do not accept any rent from him unless and until the tenant has signed the rental agreement and it contains an explicit description of the work he is to do and a completion date. 

If he takes possession without having signed a written rental agreement, you may give him a 24-hour notice to terminate under ORS 90.403.  The statute contemplates an improper subleasing arrangement which is not the case here.  However, in all respects, it should work, since his possession is unauthorized and in possession without a signed rental agreement.  Make sure that you use the proper form of notice, as this is not the same situation as giving a 24-hour notice for outrageous conduct under ORS 90.396.  Alternatively, if you have rules in the community that prohibit occupancy without a written rental agreement, you could issue a 30-day notice under ORS 90.630(1)(b).  That way, if he cured by signing the rental agreement (with the repair provision in it) he could stay.  This second alternative, though more time consuming, gives him a chance to come into compliance before having to vacate.

For example, after an applicant is charged an application fee, has been accepted and is about to move in to the home, does the landlord have the right to charge the new resident a ""move-in"" fee?

Answer:  This question involves 90.297,  which provides as follows: 
•	Except as permitted in ORS 90.295 (fees for tenant screening charges) a landlord may not charge a deposit or fee, however designated, to an applicant who has applied to a landlord to enter a rental agreement for a dwelling unit. 
•	A landlord may charge a deposit, however designated, to an applicant for the purpose of:
o	Securing the execution of a rental agreement, after approving the applicant’s application but prior to entering into a rental agreement.
o	Is so, the landlord must give the applicant a written statement describing:
•	 The amount of rent and the fees the landlord will charge and the deposits the landlord will require; and 
•	The terms of the agreement to execute a rental agreement and the conditions for refunding or retaining the deposit.
•	 If a rental agreement is executed, the landlord shall either apply the deposit toward the moneys due the landlord under the rental agreement or refund it immediately to the tenant. 
•	If a rental agreement is not executed due to a failure by the applicant to comply with the agreement to execute, the landlord may retain the deposit.
•	If a rental agreement is not executed due to a failure by the landlord to comply with the agreement to execute, within four days the landlord shall return the deposit to the applicant either by making the deposit available to the applicant at the landlord’s customary place of business or by mailing the deposit by first class mail to the applicant.
•	If a landlord fails to comply with these rules, the applicant or tenant, as the case may be, may recover from the landlord the amount of any fee or deposit charged, plus $150. 

Based upon the above, it is my opinion that it would be improper to charge a “move-in fee,” unless it was designed to secure the execution of the rental agreement before the applicant took occupancy.  If the rental agreement is already signed, there is nothing to “secure” and the fee would be inappropriate.

Recently representatives of Oregon Housing and Community Services (“OHCS”) were at the community and stopped by the office.  They started asking for documents, copies of forms etc.  What are my rights as a manager or community owner when it comes to these types of situations?

Answer:    Normally, I don’t like to equivocate, but here, I’m going to have to do so.  I suspect this answer might be quoted to the OHCS as a reason for declining to cooperate, so want to be careful how I answer.  So rather than give a definitive “Yes” or “No” I’m going to give you some things to think about, before turning over documents to anyone other than a bona fide applicant who wants to rent a space.

1.	Ask yourself: “How am I benefited by turning over my documents and forms?”  From where I sit, I see no benefit.  OHCS is not applying for tenancy.  If they can explain to you what good comes to your park by turning over forms that you or MHCO paid to have developed, I might change my mind.
 
2.	Ask yourself: “What can they do if I decline?”  OHCS describes its services and functions as follows:

“Oregon Housing and Community Services is Oregon's housing finance agency, providing financial and program support to create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income. 
  
The current agency was created in 1991, when the legislature merged the Oregon Housing Agency with State Community Services. The coordination between housing and services creates a continuum of programs that can assist and empower lower-income individuals and families in their efforts to become self-reliant. 
  
OHCS administers federal and state antipoverty, homeless and energy assistance, and community service programs. 
  
OHCS also assists in the financing of single-family homes, the new construction or rehabilitation of multifamily affordable housing developments, as well as grants and tax credits to promote affordable housing.” 

These are all worthwhile and laudable goals.  But I don’t see anything on their website [here] suggesting that they are an enforcement or regulatory agency.  So, it appears that a polite refusal to share the forms and other documents you use to operate your community will not be met by any sanction. If they can explain to you what they will do if your refuse to cooperate, and it appears they could visit upon you and your community a parade of unpleasant horribles, I might change my mind.

3.	Ask yourself: “Well, if they are not a regulatory or enforcement agency, can there be any harm in cooperating?”  In looking at their website, it is clear that part of their mission is to: “…create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income.”  Oregon law protects against discrimination in the sale, leasing or renting of housing, bases upon “source of income.”  [See, ORS 459A.421.] 

Today, there is a case pending before the United States Supreme Court,  which will address whether discrimination arising from “disparate impact” is a violation of the Fair Housing laws. What is “disparate impact?” It means that you, as a landlord or manager, can be held to have discriminated against a member of a protected class – not because of any intent to do so – but merely because your rules, policies, or procedures in the application process, affect them more harshly than other people not in the class.  

It is clear from their website and stated mission, that fair housing is an important issue with the folks at OHCS. That’s a good thing. But my mission is to protect – through education – MHCO’s members with good risk management procedures.  My experience has been that most alleged violations of fair housing laws are inadvertent, sometimes through the use of testers.  That being the case, my concern in voluntarily turning over forms and documents used in managing your community, someone at OHCS might see a policy, rule, or screening criteria, that they interpret as a per se’ violation of state, federal, county or city housing laws. [To put a fine point on this, go to the Fair Housing Council of Oregon’s chart here, identifying the plethora of laws you are already expected to comply with, depending on the location of your community.] 

While I do not see that OHCS could do anything to you if they saw a potential violation, I certainly could see the documents, or information gleaned from them, being turned over to private or public entities that could do something, either through civil action or regulatory action.  

So, if OHCS can explain to you (a) why they need the information; (b) what they would do if they did see something they didn’t like; and (c) what assurances they can give you that they will not turn the documents or information over to a third party for some sort of enforcement action. It they can provide you with such assurances, I might change my mind.

As I have said above, OHCS’s aspirational goals are laudable, and we should have no issue with them. If you want to assist in those goals, you should financially contribute to their cause. But you must also be prudent in your management decisions, balancing the risks versus the benefits, of cooperation.  I see no benefits, but I do see great risks.

I. INTRODUCTION: OVERVIEW OF CURRENT LENDING CLIMATE FOR MHP’S

Everyone knows that interest rates in re- cent years – in the wake of the financial melt- down that occurred in the mid-2008 to mid-2009 timeframe – have been at historic lows. While in the past few quarters of 2013 rates have crept up slightly, interest rates are
still favorable from a historical perspective. Clearly, none of us have crystal balls as to how long rates will remain at these relatively attractive rates. So no guarantees on the duration of this favorable market for interest rates can be made.

Nevertheless, if you either own a mobile home park (“MHP”) and you’re considering a refinance, or you are contemplating acquiring one, at least commercial lenders with savvy in the MHP arena appreciate the di- versification to their portfolios which having loans to MHP owners pro- vides.

This has been especially true in the wake of the crisis ensuing from the high default rate on Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities. Thus, while an oversimplification, the financial debacle of 2008-2009 was largely precipitated by many securitized loans going “south” due to credit being overextended primarily on residential mortgages.

In contrast, MHP’s are viewed by lenders as attractive to finance precisely because housing opportunities that MHP’s offer are monetarily more feasible for many for whom single family homes are economically out of reach. Because MHP’s also comprise a different kind of housing than condominiums, apartments, or single-family homes, and are available to various income levels, they inherently provide a level of diversification for Lenders’ portfolios.

With this as introduction to the current lender climate vis-à-vis pro- viding loans with MHP’s as collateral, we turn now to address a particular quirk specific to such loans.

II. BORROWING ENTITY

One unique issue that arises in the context of loans secured by a MHP is that frequently a MHP owner also owns, or perhaps through foreclosure acquires, mobile homes located on various spaces throughout the park.

If these homes are titled in the borrowing entity, then these homes will end up as collateral for the loan, in addition to the MHP itself, including all amenities (usually at least one clubhouse and a pool area) located at the park.

We recommend that an entity separate and apart from the Borrower should be established to take title to such homes. While there are in- evitable expenses to set up and maintain another entity, such costs are trivial in light of the potential liability exposure and/or hassles entailed in having title to both mobile homes and the park itself being vested in the same borrowing entity.

The primary concern as to liability exposure is illustrated by a thankfully rare example that occurred within the last few years in Texas. Tragically, a park-owned home caught fire, burned down, and an occupant of the home died in the blaze. In our unfortunately litigious society, where plaintiff’s attorneys target deep pockets, this scenario creates the possibility whereby all assets of the Borrower could be at risk. With a single entity owning both the MHP and homes, the “pockets” of the owner of the mobile home run as deep as the pockets of the park owner, since in this scenario these pockets are one and the same.

There are also hassles entailed in having the same borrowing entity hold title to the park as holds title to homes located at the park. A prime ex- ample of such hassles pertains to the limits on the Borrower/Owner’s flexibility in dealing with their park-owned homes. Because these homes will be additional collateral for any loan to the Borrower/Owner, the homes will not be easily saleable if the Owner wants to sell or otherwise dispose of them. Generally, these homes will be encumbered due to the UCC filings any commercial lender will insist on as part of standard lending practices.

Frankly, the liability exposure issue exists even for a park owner who eventually pays off their loan and owns their park and homes free and clear. Using one entity to own both the MHP and homes for rent at the park (along with the underlying spaces) inherently deepens the Owner’s pockets in the eyes of any plaintiff’s attorney representing a resident who is injured due to some claimed defect of the home itself. This assumes, of course, that the resident’s attorney could demonstrate that, for in- stance the Owner had been negligent in creating or allowing some unsafe condition to exist.

If you were going to refinance a MHP that you already own, and you currently own some homes in the same entity that will be the refinancing entity, then during the loan negotiations is the time to raise the issue with the lender as to transferring those homes to another entity which will not be the borrowing entity, such that the homes will not become a part of the collateral in the refinance.

Our experience in negotiating this kind of “carve out” for the homes not to comprise part of the collateral has been very favorable. Frankly, most lenders experienced with making loans to MHP’s prefer not to have mobile homes serve as part of their collateral, due to the increased liability exposure issues, discussed briefly above. This is contra the general principle that lenders want to have as much collateral as possible.

Another issue worth touching on in the parameters of this discussion on financing or refinancing MHP’s is that, similarly to apartment complexes or shopping centers, the lender is going to want to evaluate the quality and condition of the infrastructure. This means that before even contacting a lender, you would be well served to realistically assess the condition of the existing amenities, whether repairs or refurbishing or upgrades should be undertaken, etc.

Clearly, any commercial lender is going to require certain reserve funds be set aside in order to accomplish routine maintenance, as well as deferred maintenance and periodic upgrading of the existing amenities. So it be- hooves a prospective borrower to realistically assess what is likely to be needed and/or required by a lender, and to budget for these items and perhaps undertake to perform some maintenance prior to undertaking a refinance. (With an acquisition, of course one would be negotiating with the seller to provide either funds to be withheld from the sales price, or to undertake certain repairs or upgrades prior to the acquisition being completed.)

III. CONCLUSION


While commercial interest rates have started creeping up, they are still relatively favorable from a historical perspective. Because of the diversification which MHP financing offers for lenders’ portfolios (as well as for investors’ holdings), acquisition loans or refinancing of MHP’s are still far more readily available than they were a decade or more ago.

As discussed above, due care should be taken to have any homes at the park which the park owner intends to own (or that the park owner acquires through foreclosures) have title taken in a separate entity to avoid in- creasing the liability exposure for the park owner, as well as to facilitate an owner’s right to more easily dispose of such homes, at their discretion.

"407","407","3","Phil Querin Q&A Resident Growing Marijuana Plants","Question: While working on another house in the community the manager discovered that the neighbor had a large garden of marijuana plants.  The resident claims to have a medical marijuana card.   What are my rights as a community owner?  Can I ask to see the card?  Does the card have to be current?  If he has a medical marijuana card what are my rights?  If he DOES NOT have a medical marijuana card what are my rights?  Finally, the smell from these plants is very pungent and other residents are complaining about the smell.  Can I give the resident who is growing the marijuana a 30 day notice for disturbing the peaceful enjoyment of other residents due to the odor?


Answer:  This is a very complicated issue on several levels.  For example, marijuana is a controlled substance under Federal Law.  Under Oregon law, use and cultivation in limited amounts pursuant to a lawful Medical Marijuana Card are legal.   The Oregon laws are linked here. The statutes cover such things as grow-site registration; medical uses for marijuana; issuance of an identification card; and limitations on a cardholder’s immunity from criminal laws involving marijuana.  For those interested, these statutes should be consulted.  

You have a responsibility to make sure that laws are not being violated in the community. You also have a responsibility to the rest of the other residents. Compliance with all laws is a condition of occupancy under the park’s rental agreement, its rules, and the Oregon Residential Landlord-Tenant Act.  I know of no way you can honor your obligations except to ask to see the card and verify that it is current and held in the name of the resident.    

The main issue here is Fair Housing Laws.  If the resident has a valid card, then arguably he have some medical condition that has authorized its issuance.  Does he have a legal right to demand that under the Fair Housing Laws, you make a “reasonable accommodation” for his medical condition, and permit him to continue in his grow operation?   Not necessarily.  

In January 20, 2011, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) issued a Memorandum, the subject of which was “Medical Use of Marijuana and Reasonable Accommodation in Federal Public and Assisted Housing.” While the Memo was limited to federal public and assisted housing, it can be regarded as a helpful – though perhaps not a “final” resource - on the issue.   It is very complete and helpful for all park managers and owners. It can be downloaded at: https://www.google.com/search?q=hud%20medical%20marijuana.



Here is what the Memo directs:

Public housing agencies “…in states that have enacted laws legalizing the use of medical marijuana must therefore establish a standard and adopt written policy regarding whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance for residents who are medical marijuana users.  The decision of whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance to medical marijuana users is the responsibility of PHAs, not of the Department.” 

Thus, HUD seems to be skirting the issue, leaving it up to the agency in the state that permits the use of medical marijuana.  Between the lines, it appears that HUD will not enforce a fair housing reasonable accommodation claim against park ownership or management if the community has an anti-marijuana policy in place.  Without such a policy, my inclination is that enforcement would be potentially riskier, since the card-holder was not aware of the limitation at the inception of the tenancy.  

In answer to your specific questions:
•	Clearly, the card has to be valid and current in Oregon.  A California card, for example would not suffice.  (See, State v. Berrenger, 2010).
•	If there is no card, or no current valid card, the growing (not use) of marijuana could be is a violation of state law.  You may not be able to issue a 24-hour notice under ORS 90.396, since possession of certain amounts of marijuana pursuant to a valid card, is protected.  However, you may consider issuances of a curable 30-day notice under ORS 90.630;
•	If others are complaining about the odor, you have an issue between enforcing the use and enjoyment provisions of your rules or ORS 90.740(4)(i) versus permitting the activity if the resident has a lawfully issued Oregon card and is not growing over the proscribed amount.

In any event, I would recommend that your community institute a medical marijuana use policy as a part of your rules and regulations.  See, ORS 90.610 for the law regarding rule changes.  Note that the right to implement a rule change – even if it results and a material change to the tenant’s bargain with the park – is expressly permitted.  In other words, you may want to proscribe ALL such activity, even if it pre-existed the new rule.  Alternatively, you could grandfather in current card-holders.

However, as John points out, “…Oregon fair housing law is ""substantially equivalent"" to federal fair housing law.”  So, generally speaking, on the issue of medical marijuana, as goes the federal law, so goes Oregon law.

•	To reiterate what I said in last week’s article, it is my opinion that park management should institute a medical marijuana policy in the rules, dealing both with the use and cultivation of the substance inside the community.  It is not a fair housing violation to prohibit it in the rules.

"412","412","3","Phil Querin Q&A: Tenant Sub-Leases - Refuses Background Check ","Question: An occupant lives in a home that is sub-leased from his parents who have moved to Arizona. The occupant has been in the house since the beginning of January, and pays his rent on time.  Although he was asked to complete and submit a criminal background check, he still has not done so. Accordingly, we have not given him a written rental agreement to sign.  What are our rights at this point in time?
 
Answer: There are several issues here.  One, you’ve accepted rent from the occupant for the last several months.  For all intents and purposes, you have accepted him as a tenant – even though he is not there on a written rental agreement and even though you have no criminal background check on him.  Even if your rules prohibit subleasing, that too, has been waived.  In other words, all of the breaches you could have enforced against him and/or the tenants who subleased, have been waived and are now unenforceable.
 
Here are the rules on waiver that apply in this situation [ORS 90.412].  While they are of no help in this situation, they may be helpful in the future.
 
A landlord waives the right to terminate a rental agreement for a particular violation of the rental agreement or of law if the landlord:
• During three or more separate rental periods, accepts rent with knowledge of the violation by the tenant; or
• Accepts performance by a tenant that varies from the terms of the rental agreement.
• A landlord has not accepted rent for purposes of subsection (2) of this section if:
o Within 10 days after receipt of the rent payment, the landlord refunds the rent; or 
o The rent payment is made in the form of a check that is dishonored. 
• A landlord does not waive the right to terminate a rental agreement for a violation under any of the following circumstances: 
o The landlord and tenant agree otherwise after the violation has occurred.
o The violation concerns the tenant’s conduct and, following the violation but prior to acceptance of rent for three rental periods or performance, the landlord gives a written warning notice to the tenant regarding the violation that:
• Describes specifically the conduct that constitutes the violation, either as a separate and distinct violation, a series or group of violations or a continuous or ongoing violation;
• States that the tenant is required to discontinue the conduct or correct the violation; and
• States that a reoccurrence of the conduct that constitutes a violation may result in a termination of the tenancy pursuant to ORS 90.392, 90.398, 90.405 or 90.630.
o The tenancy consists of rented space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home, and the violation concerns:
• Disrepair or deterioration of the manufactured dwelling or floating home;
• A failure to maintain the rented space;
• The termination is under ORS 90.396 [24-hour notices].
o The landlord accepts:
• A last month’s rent deposit collected at the beginning of the tenancy, regardless of whether the deposit covers a period beyond a termination date;
• Rent distributed pursuant to a court order releasing money paid into court; or
• Rent paid for a rent obligation not yet due and paid more than one rental period in advance.
• For a continuous or ongoing violation, the landlord’s written warning notice remains effective for 12 months and may be renewed with a new warning notice before the end of the 12 months. 
• A landlord that must refund rent shall make the refund to the tenant or other payer by personal delivery or first class mail. The refund may be in the form of the tenant’s or other payer’s check or in any other form of check or money.
 
The most important thing you should do at this point is to try to determine if this occupant is a sexual predator.   Oregon laws were revised a few years ago to provide that if an occupant is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587, you may unilaterally issue him a 30-day notice to vacate.

Background. The National Flood Insurance Program (“the Program”) was created by Congress in 1968 to mitigate the financial impact of floods on residents and communities. It also encouraged smarter planning choices [and discouraged some development] in areas with an unacceptable risk of flooding. The NFIP is controlled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”). 

Financial History of the Program.  Historically the Program has not been run in a prudent financial manner. From its inception in 1968 to the present, Congress has failed to pass legislation to address problems within the program, instead choosing to pass multiple extensions.  With losses estimated in the billions of dollars after severe flooding events such as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Irene, and more recently, Sandy, the Program’s resources have become depleted.  According to the Government Accounting Office (“GAO”): 

""The potential losses generated by NFIP have created substantial financial exposure for the federal government and U.S. taxpayers. While Congress and FEMA intended that NFIP be funded with premiums collected from policyholders and not with tax dollars, the program was, by design, not actuarially sound. As of November 2012, FEMA owes the Treasury approximately $20 billion, up from $17.8 billion pre-Sandy, and had not repaid any principal on the loan since 2010."" 

In January 2013, Congress passed legislation to temporarily increase NFIP’s borrowing authority to $30.4 billion. 

Oregon Landlord-Tenant Law.  ORS 90.228 (Notice of location in 100-year flood plain) provides as follows:

 (1) As used in this section, “100-year flood plain” means the level that flood waters may be expected to equal or exceed once each 100 years, as determined by the National Flood Insurance Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) If a dwelling unit is located in a 100-year flood plain, the landlord shall provide notice in the dwelling unit rental agreement that the dwelling unit is located within the flood plain.
(3) If a landlord fails to provide a notice required under this section, and the tenant of the dwelling unit suffers an uninsured loss due to flooding, the tenant may recover from the landlord the lesser of the actual damages for the uninsured loss or two months’ rent. [2009 c.306 §2]
 
Does ORS 90.228 apply to manufactured housing parks?  It appears so, since the definition of a “dwelling unit” means not only a residential rental structure, but also “…a space for a manufactured dwelling or recreational vehicle *** and not the manufactured dwelling….” See, ORS 90.100(11)

Accordingly, park owners in or near flood zones need to give the required “100-year flood plain” notice to their residents. In addition, a new law known as the “Biggert-Waters Insurance Reform Act of 2012,” is going to create two new headaches for park owners located in or near flood zones.

Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (“the Act”). Although the Act became effective on July 6, 2012, there has been relatively little attention given to the new law until now. 

Problem No. One (The Subsidy Phased-out). The Act implemented a number of changes, but the most significant for park owners is the phase-out of flood insurance subsidies for certain property owners. The rationale for the phase-out is twofold: (a) To bring in more revenue for FEMA; and (b) To make the cost of flood insurance more accurately reflect the actuarial risk. The result, not surprisingly, is that many property owners are now finding themselves facing the prospect of unaffordable coverage and/or properties they are unable to sell due to unexpectedly high flood insurance premiums. 

Problem No. Two (Re-drawing FEMA Maps). In addition, FEMA has been redrawing the flood maps for communities across the US.  As a result, some properties not previously required to obtain flood insurance have now been classified as high-risk. 

Coverage and Rates. Under the Act, homeowners, renters, and business owners may purchase federally-backed flood insurance through private brokers. Rates and coverage is federally determined and is identical regardless of insurer; rates are set in compliance with the Program. Here is a summary of coverage:  

•	Homeowners may insure for up to $250,000 in property damage plus $100,000 for the contents of the property;
•	Renters may insure for up to $100,000 for the contents of their rental unit;
•	Business owners may insure for up to $500,000 for the premises and contents of their business in total; 
•	Owners of multi-family housing (5+ units) are entitled to a full $500,000 coverage policy and unit occupiers may insure the contents of their dwellings separately for up to $100,000.

High-Risk Areas. Insurance is available for homeowners and business owners in high-risk areas, called Special Flood Hazard Areas (“SFHAs”).  They are defined as “any land that would be inundated by a flood having a 1-percent chance of occurring in a given year.” These areas are identified and mapped by FEMA. Home or business owners in SFHAs who acquire a loan from a federally regulated and insured lender must carry insurance for the life of the loan. This constitutes just about every residential loan program in the marketplace, i.e. conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, etc. - except private loans. Just the same as with fire insurance, if coverage lapses, lenders may “force-place” a flood insurance policy on the property. Homeowners, renters, and business owners in low-to-moderate risk areas may also purchase flood insurance, although it is not mandatory.

The Subsidy Phase-Out. The phase-out is expected to affect roughly 20% of properties under the Plan, or about 1.12 million of the 5.6 million flood insurance policies in effect. Initially, structures built before a community adopted a “Flood Insurance Rate Map” (“FIRM”) were allowed to purchase flood insurance coverage with subsidized rates. [These are referred to as “Pre-FIRM” properties.]  Now, under the Act, the Pre-FIRM Properties, estimated to be about 5% of the 1.12 million flood-insured properties, will see increases phased-in immediately. Additionally, the following properties – formerly subsidized – will also see their premiums increase: 

1.	Second homes;
2.	Businesses;
3.	Severe repetitive loss properties – properties with 1-4 residences making multiple claims under flood insurance policies;
4.	Substantially improved or damaged properties.

Subsidies will be phased out at a rate of 25% per year until the property owner is paying premiums commensurate to the property’s risk level.  This will apply to: (a) Any property purchased after the effective date of July 6, 2012; and (b) Any property not previously covered by flood insurance.  Any property that was covered by a lapsed policy, including primary residences, will not be eligible for any subsidy going forward. For park owners whose property is located in a flood zone, this could mean a substantial increase in premiums.

Serving Oregon and SW Washington

Following is an article from by King County Office of Civil Rights.  While written with rental properties in mind, it is none-the-less relevant and instructive for housing providers of all kinds, such as Realtors®, homeowners associations, etc.  
  
Disability is a protected class under the federal Fair Housing Act1, and includes both physical and mental disabilities.

“Can you handle your own finances?”  “How do you get in and out of the shower?”  “Don’t you need someone to take care of you?”

These are questions the average prospective tenant does not expect to hear when seeking an apartment. However, many people with developmental disabilities routinely get questions like these from housing providers. More people with developmental disabilities are living independently these days, and housing providers need to be mindful of their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act1.

What is a Developmental Disability?
Developmental disabilities are a diverse group of physical, cognitive, psychological, sensory, and speech conditions that begin anytime during development up to 18 years of age.  About 17% of US children under 18 years of age have a developmental disability. Developmental disabilities include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism or other neurological conditions that result in limitations of general intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior.  Some people with developmental disabilities use mobility aids such as wheelchairs, canes, or leg braces, and will require accessibility features in their dwellings, such as ramps, lever door handles, or bathroom grab bars.  Others have speech disabilities and may speak very slowly or be difficult to understand. Some have sensory disabilities such as low vision or deafness. Some have learning disabilities, mental retardation or other cognitive conditions that cause their processing of information to be slower. A number of folks with developmental disabilities use the services of drop-in caregivers or live-in aides to assist them with activities of daily living (shopping, cooking, bathing, housekeeping, etc.).

Advocates
A number of those with developmental disabilities have an “advocate” who may be a relative, friend, caseworker, or other individual who assists them in dealing with complex issues.  For example, an advocate may accompany the prospective tenant to view an apartment and to help interpret the rental agreement. Often, an advocate is available to assist the tenant and the housing provider if a tenancy problem should arise.  

Some people with developmental disabilities may seem unsophisticated or even naive. Housing providers often mistakenly react by treating them differently than they treat other tenants. Many tenants with a developmental disability report that housing providers have asked them extremely personal questions, entered their apartments without notice, or taken advantage of their lack of sophistication. 

Like other tenants with disabilities, folks with developmental disabilities may have accommodation needs; like all other tenants, this group wishes to be treated with fairness, respect and dignity.

Reasonable Modifications
Many people with developmental disabilities may have problems accessing their unit due to their use of wheelchairs, crutches, or other mobility devices. They may need to make alterations in their units in order to have better and / or safe access. Fair Housing laws require that housing providers permit, at the expense of the person with a disability, reasonable modifications of existing premises if necessary for the tenant’s full enjoyment of the premises.  <For subsidized housing projects, the cost is borne by the housing provider.>  For example, a tenant should be allowed to widen a doorway for wheelchair access. 

A housing provider may condition permission for the modification based on the tenant agreeing to restore the unit to its original condition when the tenant vacates the unit.  However, the tenant need not remove the modifications if they will not interfere with the next tenant’s use and enjoyment of the unit (for instance, a wider door need not be made smaller again). The housing provider may ask that the tenant set up an interest bearing account not to exceed the amount of the modifications to cover the cost of returning the apartment or house back to its original configuration. 

A tenant with a developmental disability should be permitted to make the following types of reasonable modifications:  installing ramps, grab bars, audible and visual call mechanisms, widening doors and lowering cabinets. The modifications are not limited to the tenant’s unit but may be requested for common areas, recreational areas, entrances to the building, laundry room and the garage. This is not an exhaustive list of the types of modifications that a tenant might request. A housing provider should review each request on a case-by-case basis.

Reasonable Accommodations
While equal treatment is required in most respects, a housing provider has a duty to treat a tenant with a developmental disability differently with respect to reasonable accommodations. The need for reasonable accommodations can arise at the admissions stage, during the tenancy and during the eviction process. A housing provider must make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when necessary to provide tenants an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. When a tenant’s disability makes it difficult for him or her to comply with certain rules, the housing provider may need to provide extra help and / or extra time so that the tenant can comply.  For example, as an accommodation, a housing provider can make a phone call to remind a tenant with memory problems to pay rent on the first of each month. 

Tenants with developmental disabilities may request reasonable accommodations orally or in writing. Once a tenant initiates an accommodation request, the housing provider is entitled, in most cases, to a letter of verification of the existence of the tenant’s disability and need for the accommodation.

There are very limited situations where a housing provider does not have to provide a requested accommodation. It is not a reasonable accommodation to tolerate a tenant who poses a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants or employees of the housing provider.  However, it would be a reasonable accommodation to approve a tenant’s plan for acceptable minimization or elimination of the direct threat of the behavior.  If the tenant fails to follow the plan and repeats the violating behaviors, the tenant may no longer be entitled to the protection of the fair housing laws.  

Examples of Reasonable Accommodations:
•	Providing a prospective tenant with a disability with assistance in filling out the rental application upon request.
•	If asked, considering an application despite poor credit if a prospective tenant with a disability offers to have the disability check directly deposited with a payee who will ensure the rent gets paid each month.
•	Allowing a tenant to have a live-in caregiver, irrespective of occupancy standards, upon request.
•	Showing a tenant with developmental disability how to use the stove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, door locks or fire extinguishers upon request.
•	Reading notices to a tenant with a disability who has difficulty in reading upon request. Another option would be providing the notices in tape-recorded form or, with the tenant’s permission, sending copies of the notices to his or her case manager or other support person.
•	Granting a parking space to a tenant with a mobility disability upon request, even if the tenant does not drive but has someone drive for him or her. (It is preferable to provide a reserved space for that specific tenant and to mark it with appropriate signage designating it as accessible.)
•	Permitting a tenant to keep a medically necessary assistance animal despite a “no pets” policy upon request.  (Because the animal is not a pet, no deposits / fees / rent can be charged for the animal upfront; however, the housing provider can charge the same cleaning deposit it charges all other tenants.  Housing providers can expect the owner to manage the animal’s behavior (no constant barking, no property damage), to keep the animal under their control, and to handle the animal’s waste appropriately.  If the animal causes damage, the resident is financial responsible.  Such animals need not be trained, “certified,” nor have a special identifying harness or tag.)
•	Granting permission upon request for a tenant to add grab bars to his shower, at the tenant’s expense, with the work done professionally, to code, with any required permits.
•	Installing a ramp or widening a sidewalk upon request so a tenant can access the clubhouse. (Accessibility ramps are almost always considered reasonable and the widening of walkways would generally be considered so as well.  The housing provider would be responsible for this cost unless they could demonstrate that the changes would either fundamentally alter the premises or pose an undue financial or administrative hardship on them.) 
•	Providing sufficient time when talking with a tenant who has a speech disability.
•	When a housing provider has received complaints about the annoying behavior of a tenant, working with the tenant (and his or her advocate) when the tenant asserts that the behavior is related to his / her disability and requests that the provider negotiate a plan that will allow him / her to get assistance to remediate the problem.

Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing
Housing providers can promote fair housing by planning and implementing a set of fair housing policies and procedures that address reasonable modification and accommodation requirements.  This would include the following:
1.	Signs in the common area that state management’s policies
2.	An information sheet for applicants describing management’s policies and procedures with regard to accommodations and modifications during applicant screening and tenancy
3.	Policy of reviewing reasonable modification and accommodation information with each tenant along with the rental agreement; copy issued to the tenant 
4.	Forms and procedures for staff to follow when there is a situation with a tenancy that may be covered by the Fair Housing Act and local ordinances
5.	Arranging for fair housing training for managers, maintenance staff, and other employees or contractors / vendors
6.	When working with tenants who have developmental disabilities, keep the following in mind:
•	It is not appropriate to ask tenants or prospective tenants if they have a disability, what medications a person is taking, or probe about the nature or severity of a disability.
•	Not all disabilities are visible, so it is best to inform all tenants about one’s fair housing policies and advise them about the availability of assistance for tenants who have disabilities.
•	Each accommodation request must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
•	Housing providers may not reject an accommodation request based on a desire to treat all tenants alike.  Such a request can only be rejected if it is unreasonable under the circumstances, if it will impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the provider, or if it will require a fundamental alteration of the services provided to tenants. For example, if one older building in a complex has no elevator, it might be an unreasonable cost to provide a requested elevator, when the common room services available there could be moved to another, more accessible building for much less cost. 
•	Some people with developmental disabilities live in subsidized housing, while others have section 8 vouchers and seek housing in the community, and still others rely on no subsidies at all.  It should be noted that while the federal Fair Housing Act does not cover section 8 voucher holders, many local communities have fair housing ordinances that do protect them against discrimination based on section 8 and some protect other legal sources of income such as disability income.  
•	If a tenant expresses concern over possible discrimination, don’t hesitate to suggest they contact their local fair housing agency. 
•	If the applicant / tenant identifies them to you, rely on their support system, including advocates, caregivers, social service workers, etc. 


Remember, all tenants wish to be treated with respect and dignity. Although some people with disabilities may look or act somewhat differently than others, housing providers should treat them similar to the way other tenants are treated, with the same rights and responsibilities.  It’s not only the ethical thing to do, it is your legal obligation under federal, state, and local laws.

Last week’s article dealt with the National Flood Insurance Program (“the Program”) that was created by Congress in 1968 to mitigate the financial impact of floods on residents and communities. It also encouraged smarter planning choices [and discouraged some development] in areas with an unacceptable risk of flooding. The NFIP is controlled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”). Effective, July 6, 2012, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (“the Act”) became law. It mandated that flood insurance premiums were to be re-adjusted upward to reflect actuarial risk.  Up until now, the federal government had subsidized premiums, keeping them artificially low.  This new law has received little public attention – until now.  This is because the new premium structures were to commence on October 1, 2013. You can link to Part One of the article here: http://www.mhco.org/news-and-resources/community-updates/manufactured-housing-communities-or-near-floodplains ~PCQ

Re-drawing FEMA Maps. As if the new rate schedules did not create enough of a problem [as discussed in Part One], FEMA has been redrawing the flood maps for communities across the United States. As a result, some properties not previously required to obtain flood insurance have now been classified as high-risk. 

Here is how FEMA describes its mapping responsibilities:

“Through its Flood Hazard Mapping Program, FEMA identifies flood hazards, assesses flood risks, and partners with States and communities to provide accurate flood hazard and risk data to guide them to mitigation actions. Flood Hazard Mapping is an important part of the National Flood Insurance Program, as it is the basis of the NFIP regulations and flood insurance requirements.  FEMA maintains and updates data through Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and risk assessments.  FIRMs include statistical information such as data for river flow, storm tides, hydrologic/hydraulic analyses, and rainfall and topographic surveys.  FEMA uses the best available technical data to create the flood hazard maps that outline your community’s different flood risk areas.”

The following FEMA website contains extensive information regarding its risk mapping program: http://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program-flood-hazard-mapping 

In 2004 Oregon became involved with FEMA’s national five-year program called “Map Modernization, or “Map Mod”.  It was designed to update the nation’s aging floodplain maps.  Much of Oregon’s mapping was created in the 1980’s and earlier and had not been updated.  Obviously, the accuracy of these maps has suffered from out-of-date base data. FEMA’s Map Mod program ended in 2010.  


Today, FEMA’s risk mapping, assessment, and planning has assumed the responsibility for updating the information. A part of that responsibility will include re-drawing of maps.  This updating has resulted in bringing more property into the flood risk zones.

Obviously, with Superstorm Sandy, much of the attention regarding flood zones and re-mapping has focused on the east coast.  According to a January 28, 2013 Wall Street Journal article: 

The revision means tens of thousands of homeowners, landlords and businesses will have to rebuild with increased flood protections or face higher insurance premiums, while others will likely be forced to purchase flood insurance for the first time. Some structures are slated to be upgraded from A zones, where chances of flooding are about 1%, to V zones considered much more likely to flood as a result of storm surges

Are Oregonians going to face similar increases due to the redrawing of maps?  It is highly likely.  Why?  Because FEMA is now expected to stand on its own, i.e. premiums are to be increased so there will be sufficient reserves to meet future flood disasters.  However, with the outcry from flood insurance premium “sticker shock,” it is likely that FEMA will look to other sources of revenue – and this likely means the expansion of flood zones, since that will generate new additional revenues for an agency that has been used to drawing funds from the Treasury Department whenever it could not make ends meet.

MHCO Member Tips.  If your community is near a waterway, including the ocean, you should be aware of the possibility that some of the park is – or will be – in a flood zone.  You should check with your county officials to verify. Secondly, in view of ORS 90.228,  park owners should remember to give the required notice to residents.  Even though residents own their own homes, they are renting the space, and the Oregon landlord-tenant law defines the space as a “dwelling unit” for purposes of the manufactured housing side of the law.

"419","419","3","Can You Afford to Keep Utilities Included in Your Rent?","By Adam Cook, President of Commonwealth Real Estate Services

Part 1 of  2     


For better than two decades, one of the most significant and unpredictable factors influencing the bottom line of multifamily housing properties has been rising utility costs.  This doesn't cause quite as much heartburn for property owners who have wisely passed such utilities through to the residents to pay in addition to their rent.  However, for the overwhelming majority of properties, particularly those which were developed prior to the 90's, the rent charged typically includes any combination of utilities including water, sewer, garbage, and to a lesser percentage electricity, natural gas, cable television/satellite, and internet services.
 
From one year to the next, the only certainty one can realistically expect is that rents will need to be adjusted just to keep pace with the utility increases that are coming one's way from the various providers.  The annual questions are always, how much will they collectively go up, will they increase more than I am comfortable with recouping from my community residents, and will there be room to also keep up with inflation on my other increased operating costs?  Double digit percentage rate increases aren't just exclusive to medical insurance companies.  We have witnessed year-over-year, +20% increases with one sewer treatment provider alone and have seen huge increases from just about every utility with the possible exception of phone services.
 
Another concern about utility costs is the timing of when rates increase which do not necessarily coincide with the implementation of your next rental adjustment, leaving communities absorbing increased costs until the following year.  Couple that with each and every time you try to recover these utility costs whereby you look like the quintessential greedy landlord, but in reality, you're just trying to maintain your margin.  This should lead owners to question whether they can afford to continue to keep any utilities included in their rent.  
 
 A perfect illustration of a utility you should be proactive about is water, which is also normally the driving factor behind the sewer expense.  You have probably heard that certain municipalities have increased their water rates despite a reduction in overall consumption.  This has happened, in part, due to a need to fill a budgetary hole created by less revenue generated as a result of reduced consumption.  Rates are high now and will continue to rise.  A factor to consider is that over time, the EPA will have even greater scrutiny over water districts, increased regulation and testing requirements, and reduced maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) which will require better and more expensive treatment facilities.  All this translates to more expense which will ultimately be passed on to the consumer.  One thing is for certain - you don't want to be the last one in your service district to get out from under this payment responsibility.
 
You need to be aware that your business is under attack.  Municipalities have grown to be creative in expanding their reach into your pocket by creating new sources of revenue by the addition of new fees and charges.  As an example, the City of Oregon City has the following line item charges on its utility invoice:  1. Water Treatment, 2. Water Distribution, 3. Stormwater Management (aka surface water), 4. Pavement Maintenance (aka street sweeping), 5. Wastewater Collection, and 6. Wastewater Treatment.  This is just one example, but this is not an exhaustive list.  The City of Gresham has added what it claims to be a temporary police, fire, and park and recreation fee to their utility invoicing.  The City of Everett has a charge on their utility bill for landfill fees.  Tri Cities and Moses Lake have an emergency services charge on their utility billing.  The City of Salem recently attempted to add street lighting and street maintenance to its list of fees and charges, but backed down under pressure from Commonwealth, MHCO, community owners, and community residents who protested their newly proposed fees which some considered to be a ""tax"".  I'm sure there are also other examples which I have yet to learn about, but rest assured, new fees and charges are appearing with great regularity.  The point is that we are under fire from the local municipalities which are attempting to circumvent the law by creating the equivalent of new taxes without them being referred to the voters as required by Oregon and Washington Law.
 
Many of the newer communities that were developed in the late 80's and early 90's opened their communities with utility charges separate from the rent while still paying the master bill and collecting the individual consumption charges from the residents in addition to their rent.  Since then, there has been a growing trend for communities which have recognized this better model to pass through utilities to the residents over time to get out from under the burden of playing ""catch up"".  This is more equitable to your residents, promotes conservation, and will more clearly show your valued community residents exactly what these municipalities are charging and how quickly their charges are increasing. Perhaps then, the residents may direct their ire to the appropriate party and focus their concerns in the direction it belongs with the goal of helping influence the cities or at least making them think twice before adding new fees and charges.
 
One final important point to consider, for decades residents and resident advocacy groups have lobbied for rent control in our states.  We have successfully dodged those bullets each and every time, yet rent control bills surface every legislative session in one form or another.  Imagine your state government passing legislation which restricts how much you can charge for the already affordable housing services you provide.  Consider how much your utilities have increased over time and what would happen to your cash flow and the value of your community from not being able to recover 100% of this expense.  Having utilities separate from the rent is a transparent pass through from the provider to the consumer, rather than a rent increase which would be restricted in some form, likely requiring justification with a potential review board.
 
If you have any utilities which are included in your rent, I strongly recommend that you consider passing this expense through to your residents.  Commonwealth has a solution for accomplishing all of this with minimal cost to you.  Please stay tuned for more information about our recommended solution to help you protect the investment you have made in your business in next week's follow up article.

Re-Posted from November 25, 2013

_____________________________________________________________________

Introduction.  As you know, in the 2013 Legislative Session, we were able to defeat – or at least forestall – passage of HB 3007, a bill that extensively re-worked the current law governing resident park purchases.   However, MHCO and other stake-holders, agreed that we would work diligently to see if we could find a middle ground.  An interim work group of park industry representatives was appointed to do so.  In June 2013, the MHCO board unanimously voted to direct me to work with John VanLandingham to see if we could find a solution that did not expand the current park-purchase law, but rather mirrored currently existing protocol and clarified the landlord-tenant notification process. 

For the ensuing months, the interim work group held meetings with Rep. Gene Whisnant (Republican - Bend)) and Rep. Nancy Nathanson (Democrat - Eugene), seeking to develop legislation satisfactory to all concerned.  I worked closely with John VanLandingham during this time, as we emailed concepts back and forth. During the week of November 18-22, we aggregated these concepts into a written proposal for review by the interim group and Reps. Nathanson and Whisnant.  

At a meeting held on Tuesday, November 19, with some minor adjustments, I am happy to report that consensus was reached.  Summarized below – in broad strokes – are the major concepts that will be drafted into new legislation to replace the current right of first refusal law.  Caveat: Although preliminary consensus has been reached, there is no final bill yet, and much work remains to be done to see this though to a successful piece of legislation. 

1.	Landlord Notice to Tenants. The landlord would send a written notice to each resident and to the state housing agency at the time the landlord intended to commence marketing the park for sale, or upon receipt of an offer of purchase that the landlord intended to consider (whichever first occurs). The written notice would inform residents of the following: 
a.	That they have an opportunity to compete to buy the park; 
b.	They have 10-calendar days (the owner may offer more time) to notify the owner in writing that they are interested in competing to buy the park; 
c.	That within that 10-calendar day period the residents would designate a representative to communicate with the park owner; and
d.	Notify the tenants of the availability of the OHCS/MCRC handout regarding park purchase rights.
e.	The notice would be sent to all residents  unless there was already in place an active  park purchase committee (“PPC”). Alternatively, if there was an existing committee, such as a “committee of seven” as authorized under ORS 90.600(5) that would suffice for purposes of permitting the park owner to give notice to them, rather than every resident in the park.
 
2.	Landlord Right to Seek and Negotiate With Other Buyers: Throughout this process, the landlord is permitted to seek and/or negotiate with other buyers.

3.	Financial Information. Within the 10-calendar day period, the residents’ designated contact person may request the following financial information in order to evaluate a possible purchase.  The landlord would provide the financial information within seven (7) days following receipt of the request. 
a.	Asking price, if there is one;
b.	Annual park-covered utility expenses;
c.	Annual insurance expense (most recent premium);
d.	Current vacancies ;
e.	Income (lump sum, not by space) – including any park related profit centers, e.g. storage, etc. 
f.	The number of park-owned homes.

4.	Confidentiality. The landlord may designate the financial information “Confidential.” There will be a list of permissible transferees of this information, e.g. the purchase committee attorneys, tax advisors, etc. They can be required to sign a confidentiality agreement. The information provided to the purchase committee is to be returned to the landlord intact at the conclusion of negotiations or termination of purchase efforts. The tenants would have the right to review the information presented, but it could not be copied, in whole or in part. 

5.	Timing. Within 15 calendar days following receipt of the owner’s financial information, the purchase committee is required to:
a.	Form a corporate entity capable of purchasing the park or associate with a nonprofit corporation or housing authority capable of purchasing the park and/or providing park purchase assistance and advice; 
b.	Submit an offer to purchase the park in the form of a purchase and sale agreement (“PSA”) together with a copy of the filed corporate articles or other verification of legal capacity to purchase and hold title.
c.	The terms of the transaction, including offering price, due diligence duties, schedules, timelines, conditions and any extensions are to be spelled out in the PSA.
d.	The park owner and the purchase committee, including all park residents must act in a “commercially reasonable manner”  throughout the negotiations.  
During the 15-day period, the owner may accept the tenants’ offer, submit a counter-offer with different terms, or reject the offer. If accepted or countered the transaction moves forward according to the terms. If rejected, the transaction is over.  It is no different than in any other commercial transaction.

6.	Termination of Landlord’s Duty to Negotiate Further. The landlord’s duty to negotiate further ends:
a.	If the residents fail to act with the initial ten (10) calendar day period following the owner’s notice of intent to market the property;
b.	If they fail to form the purchase entity and/or fail to submit the PSA within the 15 day period following receipt of the landlord’s financial information; or 
c.	If the parties fail to reach agreement on the price and terms of a deal.

7.	Penalties for Noncompliance. An outrageous act in total disregard of the statutes would be a violation under the Landlord-Tenant Act (e.g. the landlord closed a sale without notifying the residents according to law), with a damage formula similar to what currently exists under the Act: E.g. $X per violation, or actual damages, whichever is greater.  Injunctive relief would be available if the residents learned that the owner was negotiating to sell the park without giving notice to residents.  

8.	Exemptions: All current exemptions are retained except transactions where the park owner is going to place the funds with an accommodator in order to secure a tax deferred exchange. 

That will not be included under the opportunity to purchase law.   An exemption for charitable remainder trusts will be added.  

9.	Affidavit of Compliance: The provision requiring a park owner to sign an affidavit at the time of closing, certifying that he/she complied with the law, will be retained. All title companies require this, and there was no reason to eliminate it.

10.	Remove Current Right of First Refusal Language: The current law attempted to give residents what it called a “right of first refusal.”  However, that term, which has a specific legal meaning, was never defined operationally.  How long did the right last? Could the owner negotiate with anyone else during that time?  These questions were never addressed in the law, and it is this kind of uncertainty that results in disputes and lawsuits.  This provision will disappear under the new law.

"423","423","3","Lessons From a $76,000 Fair Housing Settlement","By Jo Becker, Education/Outreach Specialist, Fair Housing Council 
Serving Oregon and SW Washington

In May 2013, Connecticut complainants were awarded over $76K (before attorneys’ fees) by the courts in The U.S.A v. Hylton.  This is a rental case but the ruling holds several important legal lessons for any housing provider.

The complaint alleged that the Hyltons, a Black married couple, violated the Fair Housing Act  (FHA) by refusing to allow a mixed-race couple, the Bilbos, to sublet their unit to a Black woman with children because they did not want ""too many Blacks"" at the property.

The decision awarded the following damages:
•	$31,750 to Mr. And Mrs. Bilbo because their landlord made discriminatory statements to them about being a mixed-race couple, and about the race of their prospective subtenant refusing to allow them to sublet the home to an African American woman and her children because of race. 
o	$10K of this sum was awarded for emotional distress.
•	Because Ms. Wilson, the prospective subtenant, was denied the home she sought and was qualified for, she continued to live in a racially concentrated area of poverty.  Her damages were awarded at $44,431.05
o	As part her damages, the court awarded Ms. Wilson $20K for compensation for the lost opportunity to live in a neighborhood of lower crime, higher educational opportunities, and greater upward mobility.  
•	Nearly half of the judgment, before attorneys’ fees, was for punitive damages.
•	An additional $37,422 in attorneys’ fees brings the total judgment against the defendants to over $113K.
Details of the case can be found online.
•	A summary of the case is available on the HUD site:  http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2011/HUDNo.11-198.
•	A summary of the ruling is posted on the DOJ’s site:  http://www.justice.gov/usao/ct/Press2013/20130812.html (DOJ).  
•	The court’s decision can be read at http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/connecticut/ctdce/3:2011cv01543/94677/23

The Hyltons were independent rental owners managing their own property.  They initially rented to the Bilbos; however, the Bilbos found that their personal circumstances required them to move and to break the lease agreement.  The Bilbos agreed to find a suitable renter to sublease to.  When they did the defendant asked if the person is white.  When told she was Black, Hylton stated that he “did not want too many Blacks at the property” and that “the neighbors would not want to see too many Blacks there.”  The defendant also told the Bilbos the only reason they were rented the house was because his wife is white and it was “a good mix.”

There are several salient points in this case, none of them new but none-the-less noteworthy.

MRS. MURPHY’S EXEMPTION
First, the housing providers in this case were ‘mom and pop’ landlords representing themselves.  Their blatant disregard for the law and others’ civil rights is clear from the case but the harm they caused – to the complainants and to their own pocketbook – may have been avoided with fair housing education and / or by hiring a professional manager who’s practice it was to know and abide by all federal, state, and local laws.  

As their defense, the defendants argued they were not subject to the Fair Housing Act given what is commonly referred to as the ‘Mrs. Murphy’s Exemption’ which states:
Any single-family house sold or rented by an owner provided that such private individual does not own more than three such single-family homes at anyone time… if such house is sold or rented (A) without the use in any manner of the sales or rental facilities or the sales or rental services of any real estate broker, agent, or salesman, or of such facilities or services of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings… and (B) without the publication, posting or mailing, after notice of any advertisement or written notice in violation of [the FHA].
Put plainly, small, independent landlords can discriminate based on protected class only if they do not hire a professional (thereby enjoining someone else in the act of discrimination) and if they do not ‘advertise’ a discriminatory preference.  Here, ‘advertising’ means, essentially, any outward expression ranging from verbal or written statements (ads whether printed or online, flyers, etc.).  Interestingly, in this case the property in question was held by Hylton Real Estate Management, which only Mrs. Hylton had an ownership interest in.  Because her husband, Mr. Hylton did not have an ownership interest in the company that owned the property only she, not he, qualified for this exemption.  Mrs. Hylton argued that the Mr. acted as her husband and not as ‘someone in the business of renting dwellings’ in dealing with the Bilbos.  However, Mr. Hylton himself stipulated that he was in the business of renting dwellings and detailed the tasks he performs in such capacity and, indeed, his behavior substantiated this.  All of that aside, his outward expression, or ‘publication’ of a discriminatory intent trumped the Mrs. Murphy’s Exemption binding him to the full responsibilities of the FHA, even if he had had an ownership interest in the property.  

It should be clearly noted  here that Oregon state law provides greater protection than federal and does not allow for the Mrs. Murphy’s Exemption.  Essentially, all housing providers must comply with federal, state, and local fair housing laws in Oregon.

VICARIOUS LIABILITY
Secondly, this case reaffirms what preexisting case law has already established in terms of vicarious liability.  As stated in the court’s decision, “Although Mr. Hylton is the individual who directly discriminated against Ms. Wilson and the Bilbos, both Mrs. Hylton and [the company] may be held vicariously liable for this discriminatory actions.” …‘It is clear under the FHA, owners of real estate may be held vicariously liable for discriminatory acts by their agents and employees.’ Glover v. Jones  Therefore, if Mr. Hylton was acting as Mrs. Hylton’s agent, Mrs. Hylton, as sole owner of [the property] is also liable for his discriminatory actions. See Cabrera v. Jakabovitz”

DAMAGES FOR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
Here, the court said it best in its decision:  “Third, as to the request for damages for emotional distress, ‘it is axiomatic that civil rights plaintiffs may recover compensatory damages for emotional distress.’  Ragin  It is not necessary for a plaintiff to provide evidence of treatment by a healthcare professional or use of medication to be entitled to damages for emotional distress.  See Parris v. Pappas…  (distinguishing “significant” and “egregious” claims for emotional distress from “garden variety” claims…).  In the context of Fair Housing Act violations, courts have ‘recognized the severe mental trauma associated with unlawful discrimination and have upheld large compensatory awards for the victims in such cases.’  Broome v. Biondi  ‘The key factors in determining emotional distress damages are the complainant’s reaction to the discriminatory conduct and the egregiousness of the respondent’s behavior.’  HUD v. Walker  When claims have been categorized as “garden variety” – meaning the claim for distress is devoid of evidence of medical treatment or physical manifestation – the amount of damages authorized ranges from $5,000 to $125,000.  Parris”

PUNITIVE DAMAGES
As stated above, the judge found in this case that the defendant acted with evil motive and showed no remorse justifying an award of punitive damages amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.

LOST HOUSING OPPORTUNITY DAMAGES
Finally, the issue of lost housing opportunity damages is also interesting.  Here the court found that Ms. Wilson suffered based on key testimony from an expert in the field of “neighborhood effects.”  The court concluded that there were “vast differences between the neighborhoods” in which she sought to leave and that which the subject property was located in amounting to “fewer ‘life chances’.”  

It’s clearly not only important to be familiar with the federal FHA, but to know applicable state, local, and case law, as well.  Issues such as vicarious liability, and what kinds of damages may be awarded, as well as other legal precedents such as disparate impact, what constitutes illegally discriminatory advertising, etc., should all be relevant to housing providers both at the company or organizational level and at the individual level.  As this case illustrates, the owner was personally liable for her agent’s actions, even though she did not directly violate the law.  This is true for ‘rank and file’ staff / employees / contractors as well, not just owners – that is, if a maintenance tech. or leasing agent violates the law, not only is the company and property owner liable, that individual may personally be sued as well.

"429","429","3","Medical Marijuana Policy in Manufactured Housing Communities - Sample ","By:   Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC

Under federal law, marijuana in all forms is a controlled substance. Under Oregon law, limited use is permissible with a Medical Marijuana Card. The Oregon laws are linked here. The statutes cover such things as grow-site registration; medical uses for marijuana; issuance of an identification card; and limitations on a cardholder’s immunity from criminal laws involving marijuana.  For those interested, these statutes should be consulted.  

You have a responsibility to make sure that laws are not being violated in the community. You also have a responsibility to the rest of the other residents. Compliance with all laws is a condition of occupancy under the park’s rental agreement, its rules, and the Oregon Residential Landlord-Tenant Act.  As I have said previously, I know of no way you can honor your obligations except to ask to see the card and verify that it is current and held in the name of the resident.  

If a resident has a valid card, then arguably he or she is presumed to have some medical condition that has authorized its issuance.  Do not question the person regarding the underlying need for the card. Does he or she have a legal right to demand that under the Fair Housing Laws, you make a “reasonable accommodation” for his or her medical condition, and permit him to continue in his grow operation?   Not necessarily.  

Oregon fair housing law is ""substantially equivalent"" to federal fair housing law.”  So, generally speaking, on the issue of medical marijuana, as goes the federal law, so goes Oregon law.  In the 2010 case of Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, the Oregon Supreme Court addressed many unanswered questions on the use of medical marijuana in this state.  The answers contained in that case represent the most current state of medical marijuana law in Oregon both from an employment and housing perspective.  

An article by the Fair Housing Counsel of Oregon (found here) is helpful on the issue. To reiterate what I have said both in writing and at the 2013 MHCO Annual Convention, it is my opinion that park management should institute a written medical marijuana policy in its rules, dealing both with the use and cultivation of the substance inside the community.  It is not a fair housing violation to prohibit medical marijuana in the community’s rules.   However, if legal use or cultivation [i.e. according to Oregon state law] occurs in a community, and there is no existing rule against doing so, it may be difficult to bring an eviction action for the activity, unless it violates some other rule or provision in the rental agreement. 

//////////////////

Accordingly, here is a sample policy.  It should not be regarded as legal advice, and all parks and managers should have their marijuana policy reviewed by their own legal counsel.  

SAMPLE MEDICAL MARIJUANA POLICY
[TO BE ENACTED PURSUANT TO ORS 90.610(3)]

BACKGROUND. UNDER THE FEDERAL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT, 21 U.S.C. § 801, ET SEQ., IT IS ILLEGAL TO MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, AND POSSESS MARIJUANA, EVEN WHEN STATE LAW AUTHORIZES ITS USE. IN OREGON, MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA IS LEGAL, SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN ORS 475.300 TO 475.342.  FEDERAL LAW SUPERSEDES STATE LAW WHERE THERE IS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF LAWS.  THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING AMENDMENTS ACT PROVIDES THAT A DISABILITY DOES NOT ALLOW THE ILLEGAL USE OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UNDER THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.

MHCO Legal Counsel

Discussion:  MHCO has previously published a summary of the new 2013 laws directly impacting owners and managers of manufactured housing communities. The purpose of this article is to address the new landlord-tenant laws that apply to those situations in which park owners rent out park-owned homes. 
  
SENATE BILL 91

o	Resulted in a judgment against the applicant that was entered five or more years earlier.
•	When evaluating the applicant, a landlord may not consider a previous arrest if it did not result in a conviction.

HOUSE BILL 2639

Discussion: This Bill addresses several topics, including the creation of a ‘Housing Choice Landlord Guarantee Program” to mitigate damages to landlords’ dwelling units caused by tenants receiving Section 8 assistance, and revisions to state discrimination laws.  It applies to both tenants inside and outside of manufactured communities, i.e. regardless of whether the tenant owns their home or not. It becomes effective on July 1, 2014

SOURCE OF INCOME AND PAST CONDUCT IN SCREENING PROCESS 
•	Currently, a person may not, because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status, or source of income, refuse to sell, lease or rent any real property to a prospective renter/lessee.
o	“Source of income” now includes federal rent subsidy payments under Section 8 and any other local, state or federal housing assistance;
o	“Source of income” does not include income derived from a specific occupation or income derived in an illegal manner.
•	HB 2639 clarifies that the preceding prohibition does not prevent a person from refusing to rent or lease real property to a prospective renter/lessee based upon:
o	Their past conduct, so long as the refusal is consistent with local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to fair housing laws; or
o	The prospective renter’s/lessee’s inability to pay rent, taking into consideration the value of their local, state and federal housing assistance (e.g. Section 8).
•	Provided, however, the refusal to lease or rent based on the inability to pay rent must be consistent with local, state and federal law, including but not limited to fair housing laws.
•	Discussion. Regardless of the legal reason for rejecting a prospective renter/lessee, in all cases, landlords must be consistent with all applicants.  The risk and liability is very real; testers can find minor variations in a manager’s response, and depending upon what was said, claim that one tester was treated discriminatorily.  Similarly, owners and managers should always be consistent in following the screening criteria they have published.  If they do not rent to persons with a criminal record, they should be careful about making exceptions. It is the same for financial qualifications and ability to pay the rent.   

THE HOUSING CHOICE LANDLORD GUARANTEE PROGRAM
•	Definitions:
o	“Housing Choice Voucher Program” means the federal tenant-based assistance program established under Section 8 [42 U.S.C.   1437f(o)];

o	“Tenant” means an individual or a family who is determined to be eligible to receive tenant-based assistance payments under the Housing Choice Voucher Program and who has entered into a rental or lease agreement with a landlord.
•	The Housing and Community Services Department is to develop and implement the Housing Choice Landlord Guarantee Program for providing financial assistance to   landlords to mitigate damages caused by tenants as a result of occupancy under the Housing Choice Voucher Program.
•	Landlords eligible for assistance under the Housing Choice Landlord Guarantee Program must obtain a judgment against the tenant in the small claims court in the county which the property is located.

•	Local housing authorities that participate in  the  Housing Choice Voucher Program are,  upon written notice from the department that a tenant has failed to repay the amount required,  be prohibited from approving a dwelling unit for the responsible tenant, and may not enter into a contract with a landlord that provides for occupancy of the  landlord’s dwelling unit by that tenant at any future time, regardless of the area of  operation of  the  local housing  authority where the dwelling unit that sustained the  damages  was located. (This provision does not apply if it is determined that the tenant has made or is making a good faith effort to comply with the repayment agreement.)
•	The Housing and Community Services Department is required to provide an  opportunity for the  tenant to contest its determination that the tenant has  failed to repay amounts  due under a repayment agreement or that the tenant has not made or is not making a good faith effort to comply with the repayment agreement.

"431","431","3","Phil Querin Q&A Do new Oregon laws on ""Section 8"" and other sources of income mean that any applicant receiving assistance must be accepted as a resident?","Question: I just read the information regarding House Bill 2639, which addresses source of income and states that a person may not, because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status, or source of income, refuse to sell, lease or rent any real property to a prospective renter/lessee. The bill states that ""Source of Income"" now includes federal rent subsidy payments under Section 8 and any other local, state or federal housing assistance. I have always refused to accept any applicant who does not have sufficient income to pay the rent.  My policy is that a renter can pay no-more than 33% of their income for housing.  Does BILL 2638 mean that I must now rent to Section 8 applicants or anyone who is received rent subsidy payments?  

Answer:  HB 2639 will become effective on July 1, 2014. It applies to all housing, whether or not it is manufactured housing inside of a community.  The current law provides that a landlord may not refuse to sell, lease or rent any real property to a prospective lessee or tenant based upon the following factors:
•	Race;
•	Color;
•	Religion;
•	Sex;
•	Sexual orientation;
•	National origin;
•	Marital status;
•	Familial status (i.e. children under 18 years of age); and
•	Source of income.
Under HB 2639 “source of income” now includes federal rent subsidy payments under Section 8 and any other local, state or federal housing assistance.  [However, it does not include income derived from a specific occupation or income derived in an illegal manner.]

Your concern is misplaced, but you still must be careful. HB 2639 clarifies that the prohibition against discrimination does not prevent you from refusing to rent or lease real property to a prospective renter/lessee based upon their inability to pay rent.  If you have a 33% rule, and consistently apply it, you should be fine.  However, what you must do is to include in your 33% calculation, any moneys the applicant is receiving from other state, local, or federal assistance, including Section 8 subsidies (collectively “Government Assistance”).  You may not deny an applicant solely because they are receiving Government Assistance, and you must include it in your calculations.  

Conclusion. It is my opinion that HB 2639 means that going forward, you should include all Government Assistance, as well as other income, when calculating your applicants’ ability to pay the space rent.  In other words, just because they receive Government Assistance does not mean that you may deny them occupancy.  Lastly, even if they qualify under your 33% rule, after including their Government Assistance, if there are other legitimate grounds for denial, such as prior rental history or criminal record, you are still legally entitled to reject them.  

Please understand that this is not legal advice, and you should verify my interpretation with you own attorney.

"486","486","3","Phil Querin Q&A Resident Improvements and Building Code Compliance","Question: I have a resident who was given permission to build a permanent carport.  Most all of the carports in our park are free standing and permanent which is my preference. However, he constructed the permanent carport by boring holes in the ground and filling them with concrete and inserting metal mounts to which he fastened 4x4 uprights for the carport.  Building it this way, in my opinion, made it part of the real property.  I was there when construction started but was absent when it was completed. 

What now complicates matters is that he recently decided to sell the manufactured home, including the carport.  This would not have been an issue had the buyer not planned on moving the home.  I believe that since the carport is now permanently affixed to the ground, it cannot be sold as movable personal property along with the home.  He also attached the carport to the manufactured home which may complicate things, as well.  What are my rights here?

Answer:  This situation is not directly addressed in the Oregon manufactured housing laws.  First, some general observations: The manufactured housing side of the landlord-tenant law regards the “space” as the “premises.”  For example, a resident in an apartment may not, without landlord permission, intentionally make major structural changes to the interior of the premises. However, most apartments have rules against this, or it is included in the rental agreement. Your space agreement or rules may have similar prohibitions regarding major changes to the space.

In this case, however, you permitted the work to commence.  It is unclear whether you had reviewed any plans, before the work started.  You should have made this a condition of building the carport in the first place.  What about permits?  It is unclear whether they are required in your jurisdiction, but it is something you should always make sure is complied with.  

I am unclear what you mean when you say that other such structures are “free standing and permanent.”  If they are permanent, in the sense of being permanently affixed to the space, then presumably, you are treating these as structures that would remain if the home were sold and removed.  However, your independent conclusion that a structure is “permanent” and therefor stays with the space is really not the complete issue; what does the resident believe?  It was his money that presumably paid for the work, and he may have some say in whether he intended it to be a part of the home, and movable if the time came.  The same issues pertain to the new buyer.

While your opinion is important, so are those of your resident and his buyer.  For this reason, I suggest that before doing this again, you might consider addressing it in the community rules.  Some of the things that should be covered are the following:

•	Code compliance
•	Management pre-approval of completed drawings
•	Time to complete work
•	Your right to post a notice of non-responsibility for liens if the resident hires a contractor
•	Method of affixing to the ground
•	Safety of final structure and perhaps inspector sign-off
•	Who owns the structure upon completion?
•	Can it be removed upon sale and removal of the home (I suggest “yes” so long as the space is returned to its original condition and all holes are safely and completed filled, etc.)
•	Duty to keep the carport in good and safe condition – remember if it is a part of the space, absent agreement with the resident, it would be your duty, since you own the park.

In this particular case, I suggest that if you have not pre-addressed these issues with your resident, he may believe this is his structure to do with as he sees fit.  I really can’t disagree, since you permitted the project and from your question, it appears no ground rules were established regarding ownership in the event the home was moved. However, if you permit the carport structure to be removed, you should insist that the space be returned to its original pre-construction condition.  That’s about the best you can do with this situation, although establishing rules – or at least agreed-upon terms – before construction commences again, is a good idea.

This is the document that will determine where you draw the line between acceptance and denial.  Your “Screening Criteria” is a written statement of the factors the landlord considers in deciding whether to accept of reject an applicant and any qualification required for acceptance.  What can you have on that list?  That is up to you.  

Here is a brief list to get you started: unsatisfactory rental references, the absence of any prior tenant history or credit history, unsatisfactory character references, criminal history, bankruptcy filed in the past two years, payment of rent problems, no social security number, and inaccurate information on the application, insufficient debt to income ratio.  All of these are reasons for denial – it is up to you establish them as a basis for acceptance into you community.  For example – maybe you accept applicants with felony conviction that are 20 years or older – it is up to you to include that on your screening criteria.

Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions!  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations – write a “screening criteria” and apply it uniformly.  Used properly and consistently it can be a tool that keeps you above any suspicion of discrimination.  The one limit on your screening criteria is that you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or sources of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone – even if they are in a protected class – if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria that you establish in your screening criteria.  Often potential applicants will “self screen” themselves by reading your “screening criteria” and realizing that they do not qualify, thus saving you and the potential applicant time and energy.

Screening/Admission Criteria: All applicants should be presented with a full explanation of the established basis for acceptance or rejection. This should be a written statement of any factors a landlord considers in deciding whether to accept or reject an applicant and any qualifications required for acceptance - in many cases MHCO Form 10 and 10A would be applicable.  This may include:

•	Unsatisfactory rental references
•	Applicant must be 18 years or older
•	Provide two pieces of identification, one with each applicant’s photo from a government office (i.e. Driver’s License, State ID Card, Passport) and Social Security Card
•	Be gainfully employed or have verifiable income from retirement, social security or periodic income.
•	If the community is a “age 55 or older” or an “age 62 or older” Community, you must provide proof that you meet the age requirements
•	The absence of any prior tenant history or credit history
•	Unsatisfactory credit history
•	Unsatisfactory character references
•	Any criminal history
•	Insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly rental and other expense obligations (Remember - you cannot deny them based on Section 8 assistance)
•	Presence of pets or the number, type or size of pets
•	Evidence that the prospective tenant has provided landlord with falsified or materially misleading information on any material items
•	If the prospective tenant refuses to sign a new written rental agreement or lease agreement
•	The number of additional occupants
•	Adverse information contained in the public record

Additional criteria that may be added to qualify could include:

•	Minimum two-year verifiable references with previous landlords
•	No payment of rent problems over the past two years
•	Two years of verifiable employment
•	No criminal convictions
•	No tax liens
•	Sufficient income to pay all outstanding obligations after payment of rent 
•	Any individual who is a current illegal substance abuser, or has been convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance will be denied tenancy
•	Any individual or pet/animal whose residency would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals.
•	If pets are permitted they must meet the requirements of state and local laws, ordinances, and the Community in regards to number, size and breed.  Farm animals, exotic and/or wild animals, livestock and certain breeds of dogs.  You should list breeds of dogs that are not allowed in your community
•	You may want to set a percentage of net-income that should be left over after meeting all financial obligations.
•	Homes must be owner occupied – no subleasing


You MUST post your community’s screening criteria publicly in the office and provide written copies to all prospective residents.

Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications.  Do not make exceptions!  Once you make an exception for one of your criteria you are opening up the possibility of future problems.  You will be in the awkward position of having to explain why you made the exception to one applicant and not to another applicant.  The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case.  Save yourself the agony of these situations and do not make exceptions to your screening criteria.  Take the time to put your screening criteria in writing to protect yourself and provide prospective residents with a copy so that they can have the necessary information upon which to make a decision.  

Remember – you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, religion, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or source of income.  However, you can deny tenancy to anyone – even if they are in a protected class – if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria.  
For example: If someone applies for a space in your park and reveals that they are Catholic and have a bad credit record you cannot deny tenancy based on the fact that the individual is Catholic.  However, you may deny the tenancy based on the fact that the prospective tenant has bad credit so long as the minimum screening criteria have been consistently applied.

Tell the applicant that you require a certain amount of time to screen the completed application, but that they will be notified within seven days, in accordance with Oregon law.  This will give you the opportunity to complete credit and criminal checks, determine the condition of the home for pre-sale or move-in requirements, check employment and personal references; and get information about current and past tenancies.

Question: Can our park use the regular MHCO manufactured home rental agreement for RV tenants who are allowed in certain spaces throughout our manufactured home park?

Answer:  No, the park should definitely not use a regular manufactured home rental agreement for RVs.  By doing so, the park might inadvertently give the RV tenants more rights than they are otherwise entitled to under Oregon’s Landlord-Tenant Laws.

Specifically, the MHCO manufactured home rental agreement (and most other, similar manufactured home rental agreements) typically define the rented space as being used for a “manufactured home.”  This could used against the park in an eviction action.  The RV tenant’s attorney could very well argue that the RV is a “manufactured home,” and therefore not subject to a 30-day, no-cause eviction, as RV tenants typically may be evicted.

Tenant attorneys might also try to argue that the termination provisions in a manufactured home rental agreement similarly do not allow no-cause evictions.  All in all, using a regular rental agreement is not a good idea.

Instead, use MHCO Form 80 (Recreational Vehicle Space Rental Agreement).  It includes all of the usual landlord protections, plus these specific requirements under Oregon law:   (a)  That the tenancy may be terminated by the landlord without cause upon 30 or 60 days’ written notice for a month-to-month tenancy or upon 10 days’ written notice for a week-to-week tenancy; (b) that any accessory building or structure paid for or provided by the tenant belongs to the tenant and is subject to a demand by the landlord that the tenant remove the building or structure upon termination of the tenancy; and, (c) that a state agency or local government may not prohibit the placement or occupancy of an RV, or impose any limit on the length of occupancy, if the RV is located in a manufactured dwelling park, mobile home park or recreational vehicle park, occupied as a residential dwelling and lawfully connected to water and electrical supply systems and a sewage disposal system.

"448","448","3","Recreational Vehicle Question and Answer with Attorney Mark Busch","An owner of a mobile home park allows RVs to stay in spaces within his mobile home park.  He has them sign an RV nonresident agreement which states that they are not residents and they sign a set of rules and regulations that are different from what the mobile home residents sign.  Over the weekend the landlord called the sheriff to evict one of the RVs that had fallen behind in their rent.  The sheriff refused to evict the RV as a squatter for trespassing and told the landlord that the RV tenant does, in fact, have certain tenant rights under the Oregon Residential Landlord Tenant Act.  The landlord obviously disagrees believing that the RV is transient and since they have fallen behind in their rent, they are a squatter and should be immediately removed from the property for trespassing.  How does the landlord deal with this?  Does the RV resident have tenant rights even though it is an RV and they signed an RV agreement?  How should the landlord proceed with an eviction since the sheriff will not remove the RV?  Can the landlord turn off the utilities to the RV?

Answer:

The last thing the landlord should do is turn off utilities to the RV.  Under Oregon law, RV residents do qualify as “tenants,” although they are not entitled to the same rights as manufactured housing tenants.  Turning off utilities would be an “unlawful ouster,” potentially subjecting the landlord to statutory damages of up to two months’ rent, plus attorney fees.

The sheriff was also correct in not removing the RV tenant.  Since even RV residents are “tenants,” the landlord must follow the proper eviction procedures.
In this case, the first step would be to issue a 72-hour notice for nonpayment of rent to the RV tenant.  If the tenant did not cure the nonpayment within the notice period, the landlord could then file an eviction lawsuit at the county courthouse.  Each courthouse has simple check-the-box forms that make it easy for landlords to file an eviction (although if unfamiliar with the process, I always recommend consulting legal counsel).

In this circumstance, I would also recommend simultaneously issuing a 30-day, no-cause eviction notice to the RV tenant (although a 60-day notice is required if the tenant has been there for more than a year).  That way, even if the tenant cures the rent nonpayment, the landlord can still file an eviction case after the 30-day notice expires.

There is one exception that might apply to an RV tenant in some circumstances.  Namely, it is possible to not create a “tenant” if the landlord uses the right kind of agreement.  The law allows a landlord to avoid the Oregon Residential Landlord Tenant Act if a “vacation occupancy” exists.  This occurs when the landlord’s agreement specifies: 

(1) The occupant rents the space for vacation purposes only, not as a principal residence; 
(2) the occupant has a principal residence other than at the unit; and, (
3) the period of authorized occupancy does not exceed 45 days.  In such a case, the sheriff would be authorized to summarily remove the RV occupant.  However, the landlord must carefully comply with the vacation occupancy requirements to ensure that the RV occupant cannot argue he or she is a “tenant.”

"449","449","3","Phil Querin Q&A Sub Metering and Common Areas","Question: We have some questions regarding common area billing for the water sub-meters that we’re installing.  I understand that under certain circumstances, there is an “offset” we can take against the total rent reductions we are required to give residents for the common areas.  How does all that work?

Answer: The submetering statutes, ORS 90.531 – 90.539 are complex and confusing. As most owners and managers know who have explored converting to submeters, the concept is relatively simple.  But the devil is in the details, i.e. the statutes. The basic concept is that for communities with utilities [e.g. water and sewer] that are buried in the base rent, they may extract those charges from base rent, and pass them through to the residents directly for payment. The “quid pro quo” for this is that the residents' base rent is reduced in a commensurate amount, so in theory, there is no initial net difference to landlord or tenant. But when utilities are increased, it becomes the residents’ immediate responsibility to pay the increased charge – the landlord no longer has to raise the rent via a 90-day notice to recover the increase.

Your question specifically pertains to one of the “devilish details’ of this conversion process, i.e. passing through the utility cost for common areas. Specifically, you are referring to subsection (5) of ORS 90.537 (“Conversion of billing method for utility or service charges”).  

That statute provides that a landlord who has previously included utilities and services in their base rent [called “the rent billing method”] and converts to the “submeter billing method” may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submetering, begin billing for common areas to a “pro rata billing method”  [i.e. where the residents’ cost of the utility is charged and paid separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter].  This common area charge must be included in the 180-day notice to residents that precedes the submeter conversion process.  This means that the landlord would charge each resident a prorata portion of the master meter readings attributable to common area costs.  

Obviously, master meter readings do not distinguish between utility services provided to residents, versus those provided to common areas.  For purposes of determining the amount of the offset the landlord should check with the utility provider to find out the cost of its service to the common areas.  If the provider cannot provide the landlord with an accurate cost for service to the common areas, the landlord “shall assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed.”
 
Note: Only if the landlord continues use the rent billing method for the cost of utilities to the common areas may the landlord may obtain an offset against the total rent reduction given to residents. This is because if the common area utility cost is still buried inside the base rent. It would be unfair to the landlord to require a dollar-for-dollar rent reduction for all utilities, since those attributed to the common areas are not passed directly through to the tenants for separate payment.

In other words, the right of offset “…is not available if the landlord chooses to bill for the common areas using the pro rata method.”  If the cost of the utility service to the common area is apportioned on a prorate basis and passed through to the residents, there will be no need for offset against the rent reduction as a part of the conversion to submeters.   In those cases, the landlord may only apportion the common area utility cost on a prorata basis. 

For purposes of determining the pro rata charge per resident, ORS 90.534 (“Allocated charges for utility or service provided directly to space or common area”) clarifies the protocol to be followed:
•	A utility charge that is assessed to residents on a pro rata basis must be allocated among them “…by a method that reasonably apportions the cost among the affected tenants and that is described in the rental agreement.”
•	Methods that reasonably apportion the cost among the residents include, but are not limited to, methods that divide the cost based on:
o	The number of occupied spaces  in the facility;
o	The number of residents or occupants in the home compared with the number of residents or occupants in the facility, if there is a correlation with consumption of the utility or service; or
o	The square footage in each home compared with the total square footage of occupied homes in the facility, if there is a correlation with consumption of the utility or service.
•	A utility or service charge to be assessed to a resident for a common area must be described in the written rental agreement separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge for the tenant’s space.
•	A landlord may not:
o	 Bill or collect more money from residents for utilities or services than the provider charges the landlord;
o	Increase the utility or service charge to a resident by adding any costs of the landlord, such as handling or administrative charges.

"434","434","3","Phil Querin Q&A Selling Park-owned Carports to Residents","Question: At my park we would like to offer the park-owned carports for sale to the residents for $1.  I am under the impression that if we require this of all residents that we would have to give a rent reduction equivalent to the value of the carports.  Is this true?  And if this is a voluntary program (i.e. the residents can buy them if they want and then turn them into enclosed garages), would a rent reduction still be required?  

Answer:  There is no specific law regarding this issue.  However, you clearly understand the ramifications i.e. if a service or amenity is withdrawn, the inference usually is that the landlord has received some financial benefit.  In this case, the “benefit” is that the landlord is no longer responsible for maintenance, and the resident is.  My position generally is that this type of arrangement should net out to zero in cost/benefit to both sides. That is, here, if the cost of maintenance is shifted from the landlord to the resident, then there must be some offsetting benefit to the resident.  If you believe you can allocate the estimated cost that has been shifted to the resident, e.g. $5.00 per month [I am using the figure as an example – I have no idea what the actual figure might be. – PCQ] then there would be a commensurate $5.00/month reduction in rent.

The more difficult issue is whether you may “require” this.  I doubt it. The residents never signed on to ownership of a park amenity when they commenced their lease or rental. In fact, a cynic would say that you’re only doing this because of the condition or age of the carports.  I’m not, but I’m suspecting this as a response from some if you attempted to “require” that all residents assume ownership of them.  

There is also the issue of the condition of the carports. Are you going to warrant to each resident that they are in good condition?  Or, is this going to be an AS-IS sale? If the latter you most certainly cannot require they agree to take over ownership of carports when you decline to stand behind their quality.

If the idea is that once bought, a resident could “upgrade” them, you need to think the idea all the way through.  For example, any such construction must first be approved by Management. Are you going to require that all work must be performed by bonded contractors who have liability insurance and are licensed with the Construction Contractors Board?  You will need to post a Notice of Nonresponsibility for construction liens.  [I have seen liens imposed on park owned property for a resident’s construction project that was (foolishly) approved by Management.]  Are you going to permit residents to do the construction work themselves? If so, you must make clear that the work must be performed in accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances, especially the applicable building codes.  Who is going to then monitor construction to make sure what was approved is what was built? Is the manager qualified to do this, and does he/she have time?  Are you going to require the residents undertaking construction [either themselves or through a contractor] first sign an agreement to assume all liability and release the park and Management from damages?  If a third party does the work, besides licensing, you have to make sure they have workers comp insurance (i.e. SAIF).  You cannot assume all contractors have this insurance. The smaller the contractor, e.g. solos, the greater the chance they may have neglected to obtain workers comp.  If there were an accident resulting in personal injuries, e.g. falling off the roof of the new garage, without SAIF, the injured worker could look to you.

Lastly, what are you going to do upon sale of the home?  I assume the resident will be selling title to the garage. Since the garage is affixed to the land, would assume a regular “deed” be given, as opposed to a bill of sale [as is common for personal property, such as a manufactured home]. So how is this going to work?  Certainly, you don’t want residents delivering deeds to the garage, since they actually don’t own the underlying land. Yet once affixed to the land, the garage becomes a part of the land. You will certainly have to cover this issue if/when you undertake this program.  It’s possible that you would just give a revocable “license” or “permit” to the resident, allowing the use and construction, but not pure ownership.  And be careful of a resident claiming that you owe them for the value of the improvement, since upon resale of the home, you might increase the space rent because of the “enclosed garage.” 

In light of all the issues, it seems that if you decide to plow ahead with this idea, it seems to me that it should be voluntary, with adequate disclosures and releases per above, so that the resident can never say they had no choice in the matter.  There is little question in my mind, that if you made this program mandatory, a court of law would not enforce it, no matter how ironclad.

"450","450","3","Occupancy By Who's Standard (Part 1 of 2)","By Jo Becker, Education/Outreach Specialist, Fair Housing Council 
Serving Oregon and SW Washington

I recently read an article on screening by a representative of a NW property management firm.  In it was included the company’s screening requirements, as well as what was apparently their stock occupancy standard for all units:  “Maximum occupancy of no more than two (2) persons per bedroom.”

There is a growing body of case law across the country in which housing providers – both landlords and condo / homeowners’ associations – have lost cases in which they’ve had two-people-per-bedroom policies.  At this point, we have not seen a housing provider loose a case with a two-plus-one policy1, so long as it takes into account other factors such as the overall size of the unit.  The recommendation we’re seeing come out of these cases is that housing providers ought to thoughtfully consider a separate occupancy standard for each, individual floor plan, based on several factors.

The Fair Housing Council has put out more than one article on occupancy standards and related fair housing implications (available at www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm) but this is a topic that continues to come up in classroom sessions and Hotline questions.  Having also just read a couple stunning reports detailing the legal and historical context for occupancy standards, I thought I’d dive back into the subject anew to reiterate fair housing cautions and share some very illuminating information.

What follows is the first in a two-part series detailing research and commentary by two occupancy policy experts and fair housing advocates.  In this article, we’ll look at the work of Tim Iglesias of the University of San Francisco School of Law as he explores the legal implications and disparate impact of overly restrictive occupancy policies, including two people per bedroom.  In the next article, the work of Ellen Pader, an anthropologist and Associate Director of the Housing Research Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst provides revealing historical and cultural perspectives behind our country’s occupancy policies.

THE PROBLEM
Tim Iglesias states clearly that “overly restrictive private ROS [residential occupancy standards]… substantially reduce the housing choices...  Demographic trends and the prolonged economic recovery which prompts more doubling-up promise this issue will only grow in importance.”  What’s more, there are profound societal fair housing implications, regardless of individual intentions.

Iglesias proffered some suggestions to the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in a document entitled Recommendations to HUD Regarding Application of the FHAA2 to Residential Occupancy Standards.  In it he states that, “the two-person-per-bedroom standard discriminates against families.  New empirical evidence demonstrates that this finding applies to substantial proportions of studios and one-bedroom apartments...”  He sites a study that “found that families with children run afoul of the standard more than ten times as often as other households.  Ten percent of families with children live in one-bedroom units, and nearly three-quarters of those families exceed the two-person-per-bedroom standard.  

In addition, regardless of the type of unit to which it is applied, the two-person-per-bedroom standard has a disparate impact across racial lines.  National studies show that the proportion of African Americans excluded by this occupancy standard is statistically significantly higher than for whites; the proportion of Asians excluded is higher than the proportion of blacks; and the proportion of Hispanics excluded is the highest of all.  Indeed, more than one-third of all Hispanic children living in one-, two-, or three-bedroom apartments in the United States in 2007-2009 would have been displaced by rigorous application of the two-person-per-bedroom standard.  Overall, the study found that when applied the two-person-per-bedroom standard substantially limits the housing choices of many thousands of families, especially Latinos, Asians and extended families.”  

Iglesias asserts in a 2011 Memo to Fair Housing Advocates that, “[t]his problem is particularly acute in nicer housing in neighborhoods with attractive amenities (e.g., good schools, access to shopping, jobs and medical care).”  

He also explains that two-person-per-bedroom, “has a dubious origin:
1.	There is no objective evidence that the two-people-per-bedroom standard was calibrated in any way to be a standard which presumptively avoided discrimination.
2.	and, the two-people-per-bedroom standard predates the 1988 FHAA, which was intended to be remedial legislation to address previous discriminatory practices against families.
3.	…research examining the historical origins of the two-person-per-bedroom standard has found that it was neither scientific nor otherwise objectively grounded, but merely the product of classist and ethnocentric paternalism.

According to Iglesias, “there is no objective evidence that the two-people-per-bedroom standard is necessary – much less uniquely suited – to protect landlords’ reasonable interests.
1.	Rather, [it] is merely the housing industry’s traditional standard.
2.	It’s really a prophylactic policy that errs widely on the side of protecting landlords’ interests and is not designed to avoid discrimination.
3.	Moreover, in jurisdictions where FHAPs [Fair Housing Assistance Programs] employ a “two-persons-per-bedroom-plus-one” enforcement guideline, there is no objective evidence that landlords using this more generous standard have suffered any so-called “overcrowding effects.”

“Arguments that the two-person-per-bedroom standard has legal force are weak.  Even if the Keating Memo3 has some legal force, it would be the whole memo, not the [two-person-per-bedroom] standard standing alone.”  The memorandum “provides that a two-person-per-bedroom standard is “presumably reasonable” (ambiguous but apparently meaning presumptively compliant with FHAA), but that all private residential occupancy standards are subject to a multi-factor analysis to determine whether or it violates the FHAA.”

THE HARM
The problems with overly restrictive occupancy policies are numerous, leaving a multitude of households with few options.  Many are harmed as they are forced to “reconfigure their household composition,” as Iglesias puts it, “[and] split up and deprive its members of their desired living situation.  Splitting up the family can conflict with deeply held cultural preferences / norms to live closely as a way of life and to keep together the intergenerational family, the extended family, or both.” 
If unwilling to “reconfigure its composition,” then the family must either:
•	secure more housing than desired which imposes additional costs,
•	accept inferior quality housing, such housing often poses health risks to residents or 
•	accept an inferior location, “…typically in an area with worse schools, more crime, and decreased access to jobs, transportation, shopping, and other amenities.  Cumulatively, movement to these inferior locations increases economic and racial segregation.”

“Finally, the denial of housing choice by the application of a restrictive residential occupancy standard may also constitute illegal discrimination.”  Iglesias goes on to site a multitude of cases that reference the discriminatory harms incurred by ROS3.

THE JUSTIFICATION
Why do landlords impose ROS?  Iglesias asks then answers the question:
1.	“They do this for a variety of reasons.  Some are legitimate some of the time, but they are often overstated.  And landlords have a hard time documenting a clear and direct linkage between a legitimate business reason and a particular ROS.
2.	Landlords’ traditional arguments for imposing a ROS are summarized by the phrase “overcrowding” and include: 
a.	preventing a variety of economic costs caused by so-called “overcrowding,” including concerns about future property value and profits, increases in “wear and tear” costs…, extra expenses for utilities and garbage, increased (risk of) damage to the property, increased insurance costs, and increased management costs;
b.	preventing nuisance-type harms to other tenants and neighbors from “overcrowding,” including noise and increased demands for parking;
c.	to promote often paternalistic concerns about the habitability / quality of life of tenants, including the safety and appropriateness of facilities for children and purported psychological harm to tenants from living in “overcrowded” spaces, and
d.	to avoid overtaxing the carrying capacity of one or more systems of the housing unit (e.g., water or sewage).”

THE PROBLEMS WITH THE KEATING MEMO
Iglesias argues that HUD’s enforcement practices have enabled the two-person-per-bedroom standard to become de facto law, but that new empirical evidence demonstrates this standard is often discriminatory.  Part of HUD’s implicit involvement includes what was issued as an internal document from a HUD staff, Mr. Keating, but which has come to be seen as an endorsement of two-people-per-bedroom policies.  (You can view the Keating Memo and subsequent guidance from HUD at www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm.)

As Iglesias notes, “[s]ometimes defendants seek to use HUD’s Keating Memorandum as a “defense” of two-person-per-bedroom standards because the Keating Memo states that this standard is “presumptively reasonable.”  While many courts have made reference to the Keating Memo and the two-person-per-bedroom standard, no court has ever properly analyzed whether it owes any deference to the Keating Memo.  Even if the Keating Memo is due some deference, such deference would be to the whole memo including its factors analysis…”

The Keating Memo is problematic for many reasons, including its use of the two-person-per-bedroom standard as “presumptively reasonable” and its lack of clarity in how to apply the factors it advices housing providers to consider, such as the size of bedrooms and the unit, the configuration of unit, other physical limitations of the housing, state or local law, and other relevant factors.

Iglesias notes that, “any private residential occupancy standard – including two-persons-per-bedroom – is subject to review using the factors stated in the [Keating] memo…  [T]he misunderstanding among many that the Keating Memorandum provides a “safe harbor” for landlords who impose a two-person-per-bedroom standard” has caught a growing number of housing providers by surprise.

Among other things, Iglesias urges HUD to “adopt a regulation to define the appropriate liability standard and defenses and to establish a true safe harbor for landlords.  The Keating Memorandum provides a useful form for this standard, but specifics need to be worked out.”  He goes on to theorize that “[i]f studies were conducted, they are likely to show that 2.5 people per bedroom or 3 people per bedroom is a more appropriate safe harbor, at least for studio and one-bedroom units.  The Keating factors must be further specified, e.g. setting the square footage of a regular-size bedroom and defining when additional habitable space requires allowing additional occupants.”

Check back here for the next in this two-part series.  Don’t forget to go back and take a look at FHCO’s earlier articles on occupancy policies posted at www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm for additional information in the meantime.  Of course, you can find information about familial status and race, color, and national origin and other protected classes at the Council’s site as well.

  At the Fair Housing Council (FHCO), we have long recommended a policy of two individuals per bedroom plus one more individual for the unit. For example, a housing provider might limit a two bedroom-home to five individuals. This ""two plus one"" formula can help insulate the housing provider from fair housing violations based on occupancy in most situations. That being said, additional factors should always be considered in developing individual policies. 
2 The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) of 1968 coupled with the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 protected the following classes in a housing:  race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (children), and disability.  Oregon law also protects marital status, source of income, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors.  Washington law covers martial status, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors, and honorably discharged veterans / military status. Additional protected classes have been added in particular geographic areas; visit FHCO.org/mission.htm and read the section entitled “View Local Protected Classes” for more information.

"453","453","3","Comparison of Current Law to Compromise Legislation - (Community Sale Notification Process - Removal of ""Right of First Refusal"" Language from Current Statute)","Current Oregon law (adopted in 1989) already requires manufactured home park landlords/owners to notify park residents prior to a sale to another owner and to negotiate a possible sale to the residents. ORS 90.760, 90.800 to 90.840. Unfortunately, both landlord and tenant advocates recognize that the current law is seriously flawed and doesn’t work for either side. HB 4038A fixes those problems.

1.Under current law, it is unclear whether and to whom an owner must give notice of the owner’s interest in selling the park, or what that notice must say.

a.	ORS 90.760 allows an undefined tenants association to give notice to the owner of its interest in buying the park before the owner indicates an interest in selling. Apparently, this notice is good forever, even if the tenants die/move or if there is a different owner. No-one keeps track of these notices. And tenants generally do not think about buying their park until there is some indication that the owner wants to sell, so they don’t give the advance notice to the owner.

b.	ORS 90.810 appears to require notice from the owner even if the tenants have not previously notified the owner of their interest in purchasing the park.
HB 4038A amends the law to require an owner to give notice to all tenants, without advance registration, or, if there is an active tenant group with which the owner has met during the past 12 months, to that group only, whenever the owner is interested in selling or has received an offer to buy which the owner is considering. And it defines what must be in the notice. And it requires that a copy go to the Oregon Housing & Community Services Department. And it provides a safe harbor for minor errors in giving the notice. Sections 1, 3(3).

2. Under current law, owners are required to negotiate in good faith with the tenants and to give the tenants a 14 day right of first refusal to buy the park. ORS 90.820.
	a. This duty is completely open-ended, with no time limit on the duty or on the owner’s duty to negotiate. 
	b. Owners strongly dislike the concept of a right of first refusal. On the other hand, tenants think that 14 days isn’t enough time.
	c. There is no provision regarding what financial information an owner must share with the tenants in the negotiations.
	d. There is no provision making shared financial information confidential, and no provision providing a remedy to owners if tenants violate a confidentiality duty.
	e. There is no provision regarding what steps the tenants must take in the negotiation.
	f. This duty would apply to an owner even if the owner has a time-sensitive offer from another buyer.
	g. “Good faith” is not the right duty to apply in a commercial real estate transaction.

The proposed legislation (HB 4038A) removes the right of first refusal language, imposes specific timelines (10 days for the tenants to indicate interest in competing to purchase and another 15 days to make an offer), specifies what financial information must be shared and authorizes a confidentiality requirement and provides a remedy including damages if tenants violate the duty to keep the financial information confidential, and replaces “good faith” with “commercially reasonable manner.” It addresses tenant responsibilities within each of the two time periods. It explicitly exempts purchase offers from buyers with 1031 tax-exchange time pressures. And it includes specific language about the owner’s right to reject the tenant’s offer and releasing the owner from further obligations. Sections 2, 3, 4(1)(h), and 10 (amending ORS 90.820 to make it apply only to marinas).

	</ul>
 
<p><b><span id=""c250"">90.250</span> Receipt of rent without obligation to maintain premises prohibited.</b> A rental agreement, assignment, conveyance, trust deed or security instrument may not permit the receipt of rent free of the obligation to comply with ORS 90.320 (1) or 90.730.

					</ul>
			</ul>

			<ul>	
				<li>(a) A reasonable flat amount, charged once per rental period. ""Reasonable amount"" means the customary amount charged by landlords for that rental market;</li>
				<li>(b) A reasonable amount, charged on a per-day basis, beginning on the fifth day of the rental period for which rent is delinquent. This daily charge may accrue every day thereafter until the rent, not including any late charge, is paid in full, through that rental period only. The per-day charge may not exceed six percent of the amount described in paragraph (a) of this subsection; or</li>
				<li>(c) Five percent of the periodic rent payment amount, charged once for each succeeding five-day period, or portion thereof, for which the rent payment is delinquent, beginning on the fifth day of that rental period and continuing and accumulating until that rent payment, not including any late charge, is paid in full, through that rental period only.</li>

		<li>(4) A landlord may not deduct a previously imposed late charge from a current or subsequent rental period rent payment, thereby making that rent payment delinquent for imposition of a new or additional late charge or for termination of the tenancy for nonpayment under ORS 90.394.</li>
		<li>(5) A landlord may charge simple interest on an unpaid late charge at the rate allowed for judgments pursuant to ORS 82.010 (2) and accruing from the date the late charge is imposed.</li>
		<li>(6) Nonpayment of a late charge alone is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause under ORS 90.392 or 90.630 (1). A landlord may note the imposition of a late charge on a nonpayment of rent termination notice under ORS 90.394, so long as the notice states or otherwise makes clear that the tenant may cure the nonpayment notice by paying only the delinquent rent, not including any late charge, within the allotted time.</li>
		<li>(7) A late charge includes an increase or decrease in the regularly charged periodic rent payment imposed because a tenant does or does not pay that rent by a certain date.

		<li>(1) A landlord, from time to time, may adopt a rule or regulation, however described, concerning the tenant's use and occupancy of the premises. It is enforceable against the tenant only if:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Its purpose is to promote the convenience, safety or welfare of the tenants in the premises, preserve the landlord's property from abusive use, or make a fair distribution of services and facilities held out for the tenants generally;</li>
				<li>(b) It is reasonably related to the purpose for which it is adopted;</li>
				<li>(c) It applies to all tenants in the premises in a fair manner;</li>
				<li>(d) It is sufficiently explicit in its prohibition, direction or limitation of the tenant's conduct to fairly inform the tenant of what the tenant must or must not do to comply;</li>
				<li>(e) It is not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord; and</li>
				<li>(f) The tenant has written notice of it at the time the tenant enters into the rental agreement, or when it is adopted.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) If a rule or regulation adopted after the tenant enters into the rental agreement works a substantial modification of the bargain, it is not valid unless the tenant consents to it in writing.</li>

The landlord shall provide the tenant with a receipt for any security deposit the tenant pays. The landlord shall hold a security deposit or prepaid rent for the tenant who is a party to the rental agreement. A tenant's claim to the security deposit or prepaid rent is prior to the claim of a creditor of the landlord, including a trustee in bankruptcy.</li>
				<li>(b) Except as provided in ORS 86.782 (10), the holder of the landlord's interest in the premises at the time the tenancy terminates is responsible to the tenant for any security deposit or prepaid rent and is bound by this section.</li>

				<li>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a landlord may not change the rental agreement to require the tenant to pay a new or increased security deposit during the first year after the tenancy has begun. Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the landlord may require an additional deposit if the landlord and tenant agree to modify the terms and conditions of the rental agreement to permit a pet or for other cause and the additional deposit relates to the modification. This paragraph does not prevent a landlord from collecting a security deposit that an initial rental agreement provided for but that remained unpaid at the time the tenancy began.</li>
				<li>(b) If a landlord requires a new or increased security deposit after the first year of the tenancy, the landlord shall allow the tenant at least three months to pay the new or increased deposit.</li>

					</ul>
				<li>(b) A landlord is not required to repair damage caused by the tenant in order for the landlord to claim against the deposit for the cost to make the repair. Any labor costs the landlord assesses under this subsection for cleaning or repairs must be based on a reasonable hourly rate. The landlord may charge a reasonable hourly rate for the landlord's own performance of cleaning or repair work.</li>
				<li>(c) Defaults and damages for which a landlord may recover under this subsection include, but are not limited to:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Carpet cleaning, other than the use of a common vacuum cleaner, if:</li>

			</ul>
		<li>(10) A landlord shall account for and refund as provided in subsections (12) to (14) of this section any portion of a last month's rent deposit the landlord does not apply as provided under subsection (9) of this section. Unless the tenant and landlord agree otherwise, the tenant may not require the landlord to apply a last month's rent deposit to rent due for any period other than the last month of the tenancy. A last month's rent deposit does not limit the amount of rent charged unless a written rental agreement provides otherwise.</li>
		<li>(11) When the tenancy terminates, a landlord shall account for and refund to the tenant, in the same manner this section requires for security deposits, the unused balance of any prepaid rent the landlord has not previously refunded to the tenant under ORS 90.380 and 105.120 (5)(b) or any other provision of this chapter. The landlord may claim from the remaining prepaid rent only the amount reasonably necessary to pay the tenant's unpaid rent.</li>
		<li>(12) In order to claim all or part of any prepaid rent or security deposit, within 31 days after the tenancy terminates and the tenant delivers possession the landlord shall give to the tenant a written accounting that states specifically the basis or bases of the claim. The landlord shall give a separate accounting for security deposits and for prepaid rent.</li>
		<li>(13) The landlord shall return to the tenant the security deposit or prepaid rent or the portion of the security deposit or prepaid rent that the landlord does not claim in the manner provided by subsections (11) and (12) of this section not later than 31 days after the tenancy terminates and the tenant delivers possession to the landlord.</li>
		<li>(14) The landlord shall give the written accounting required under subsection (12) of this section or shall return the security deposit or prepaid rent as required by subsection (13) of this section by personal delivery or by first class mail.</li>
		<li>(15) If a security deposit or prepaid rent secures a tenancy for a space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home the tenant owns and occupies, whether or not in a facility, and the dwelling or home is abandoned as described in ORS 90.425 (2) or 90.675 (2), the 31-day period described in subsections (12) and (13) of this section commences on the earliest of:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Waiver of the abandoned property process under ORS 90.425 (26) or 90.675 (22);</li>
				<li>(b) Removal of the manufactured dwelling or floating home from the rented space;</li>
				<li>(c) Destruction or other disposition of the manufactured dwelling or floating home under ORS 90.425 (10)(b) or 90.675 (10)(b); or</li>

			<ul>
				<li>(a) Withheld without a written accounting under subsection (12) of this section; or</li>
				<li>(b) Withheld in bad faith.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(17)(a) A security deposit or prepaid rent in the possession of the landlord is not garnishable property, as provided in ORS 18.618.</li>

				<li>(b) If a landlord delivers a security deposit or prepaid rent to a garnishor in violation of ORS 18.618 (1)(b), the landlord that delivered the security deposit or prepaid rent to the garnishor shall allow the tenant at least 30 days after a copy of the garnishee response required by ORS 18.680 is delivered to the tenant under ORS 18.690 to restore the security deposit or prepaid rent. If the tenant fails to restore a security deposit or prepaid rent under the provisions of this paragraph before the tenancy terminates, and the landlord retains no security deposit or prepaid rent from the tenant after the garnishment, the landlord is not required to refund or account for the security deposit or prepaid rent under subsection (11) of this section.

		<li>(3) If the landlord knowingly fails to disclose those matters required under subsection (2) of this section, the tenant may recover twice the actual damages sustained or one month's rent, whichever is greater.</li>
		<li>(4)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Except for tenancies covered by ORS 90.505 to 90.840, if a written rental agreement so provides, a landlord may require a tenant to pay to the landlord a utility or service charge that has been billed by a utility or service provider to the landlord for utility or service provided directly to the tenant's dwelling unit or to a common area available to the tenant as part of the tenancy. A utility or service charge that shall be assessed to a tenant for a common area must be described in the written rental agreement separately and distinctly from such a charge for the tenant's dwelling unit. Unless the method of allocating the charges to the tenant is described in the tenant's written rental agreement, the tenant may require that the landlord give the tenant a copy of the provider's bill as a condition of paying the charges.</li>
				<li>(b) Except as provided in this paragraph, a utility or service charge may only include the cost of the utility or service as billed to the landlord by the provider. A landlord may add an additional amount to a utility or service charge billed to the tenant if:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The utility or service charge to which the additional amount is added is for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;</li>
						<li>(B) The additional amount is not more than 10 percent of the utility or service charge billed to the tenant;</li>
						<li>(C) The total of the utility or service charge and the additional amount is less than the typical periodic cost the tenant would incur if the tenant contracted directly with the provider for the cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;</li>
						<li>(D) The written rental agreement providing for the utility or service charge describes the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge; and</li>
						<li>(E) Any billing or notice from the landlord regarding the utility or service charge lists the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(c) A landlord may not require a tenant to agree to the amendment of an existing rental agreement, and may not terminate a tenant for refusing to agree to the amendment of a rental agreement, if the amendment would obligate the tenant to pay an additional amount for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage as provided under paragraph (b) of this subsection.</li>
				<li>(d) A utility or service charge, including any additional amount added pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection, is not rent or a fee. Nonpayment of a utility or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394 but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause under ORS 90.392.</li>
				<li>(e) If a landlord fails to comply with paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection, the tenant may recover from the landlord an amount equal to one month's periodic rent or twice the amount wrongfully charged to the tenant, whichever is greater.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(5)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) If a tenant, under the rental agreement, is responsible for a utility or service and is unable to obtain the service prior to moving into the premises due to a nonpayment of an outstanding amount due by a previous tenant or the owner, the tenant may either:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Pay the outstanding amount and deduct the amount from the rent;</li>
						<li>(B) Enter into a mutual agreement with the landlord to resolve the lack of service; or</li>
						<li>(C) Immediately terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice and the reason for the termination.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(b) If the tenancy terminates, the landlord shall return all moneys paid by the tenant as deposits, rent or fees within four days after termination.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(6) If a tenant, under the rental agreement, is responsible for a utility or service and is unable to obtain the service after moving into the premises due to a nonpayment of an outstanding amount due by a previous tenant or the owner, the tenant may either:
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Pay the outstanding amount and deduct the amount from the rent; or</li>
				<li>(b) Terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice 72 hours prior to the date of termination and the reason for the termination. The tenancy does not terminate if the landlord restores service or the availability of service during the 72 hours. If the tenancy terminates, the tenant may recover actual damages from the landlord resulting from the shutoff and the landlord shall return:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Within four days after termination, all rent and fees; and</li>
						<li>(B) All of the security deposit owed to the tenant under ORS 90.300.
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(7) If a landlord, under the rental agreement, is responsible for a utility or service and the utility or service is shut off due to a nonpayment of an outstanding amount, the tenant may either:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Pay the outstanding balance and deduct the amount from the rent; or</li>
				<li>(b) Terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice 72 hours prior to the date of termination and the reason for the termination. The tenancy does not terminate if the landlord restores service during the 72 hours. If the tenancy terminates, the tenant may recover actual damages from the landlord resulting from the shutoff and the landlord shall return:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Within four days after termination, all rent prepaid for the month in which the termination occurs prorated from the date of termination or the date the tenant vacates the premises, whichever is later, and any other prepaid rent; and</li>
						<li>(B) All of the security deposit owed to the tenant under ORS 90.300.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(8) If a landlord fails to return to the tenant the moneys owed as provided in subsection (5), (6) or (7) of this section, the tenant shall be entitled to twice the amount wrongfully withheld.</li>

<p><b><span id=""c322"">90.322</span> Landlord or agent access to premises; remedies.</b></p> 

	<ul>
		<li>(1) A landlord or, to the extent provided in this section, a landlord's agent may enter into the tenant's dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under the tenant's exclusive control in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, perform agreed yard maintenance or grounds keeping or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workers or contractors. The right of access of the landlord or landlord's agent is limited as follows:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) A landlord or landlord's agent may enter upon the premises under the tenant's exclusive control not including the dwelling unit without consent of the tenant and without notice to the tenant, for the purpose of serving notices required or permitted under this chapter, the rental agreement or any provision of applicable law.</li>
				<li>(b) In case of an emergency, a landlord may enter the dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant's exclusive control without consent of the tenant, without notice to the tenant and at any time. ""Emergency"" includes but is not limited to a repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious damage to the premises. If a landlord makes an emergency entry in the tenant's absence, the landlord shall give the tenant actual notice within 24 hours after the entry, and the notice shall include the fact of the entry, the date and time of the entry, the nature of the emergency and the names of the persons who entered.</li>
				<li>(c) If the tenant requests repairs or maintenance in writing, the landlord or landlord's agent, without further notice, may enter upon demand, in the tenant's absence or without the tenant's consent, for the purpose of making the requested repairs until the repairs are completed. The tenant's written request may specify allowable times. Otherwise, the entry must be at a reasonable time. The authorization to enter provided by the tenant's written request expires after seven days, unless the repairs are in progress and the landlord or landlord's agent is making a reasonable effort to complete the repairs in a timely manner. If the person entering to do the repairs is not the landlord, upon request of the tenant, the person must show the tenant written evidence from the landlord authorizing that person to act for the landlord in making the repairs.</li>
				<li>(d) A landlord and tenant may agree that the landlord or the landlord's agent may enter the dwelling unit and the premises without notice at reasonable times for the purpose of showing the premises to a prospective buyer, provided that the agreement:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Is executed at a time when the landlord is actively engaged in attempts to sell the premises;</li>
						<li>(B) Is reflected in a writing separate from the rental agreement and signed by both parties; and</li>
						<li>(C) Is supported by separate consideration recited in the agreement.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(e)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) If a written agreement requires the landlord to perform yard maintenance or grounds keeping for the premises:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>(i) A landlord and tenant may agree that the landlord or landlord's agent may enter for that purpose upon the premises under the tenant's exclusive control not including the dwelling unit, without notice to the tenant, at reasonable times and with reasonable frequency. The terms of the right of entry must be described in the rental agreement or in a separate written agreement.</li>
								<li>(ii) A tenant may deny consent for a landlord or landlord's agent to enter upon the premises pursuant to this paragraph if the entry is at an unreasonable time or with unreasonable frequency. The tenant must assert the denial by giving actual notice of the denial to the landlord or landlord's agent prior to, or at the time of, the attempted entry.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>(B) As used in this paragraph:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>(i) ""Yard maintenance or grounds keeping"" includes, but is not limited to, weeding, mowing grass and pruning trees and shrubs.</li>
								<li>(ii) ""Unreasonable time"" refers to a time of day, day of the week or particular time that conflicts with the tenant's reasonable and specific plans to use the premises.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>(f) In all other cases, unless there is an agreement between the landlord and the tenant to the contrary regarding a specific entry, the landlord shall give the tenant at least 24 hours' actual notice of the intent of the landlord to enter and the landlord or landlord's agent may enter only at reasonable times. The landlord or landlord's agent may not enter if the tenant, after receiving the landlord's notice, denies consent to enter. The tenant must assert this denial of consent by giving actual notice of the denial to the landlord or the landlord's agent or by attaching a written notice of the denial in a secure manner to the main entrance to that portion of the premises or dwelling unit of which the tenant has exclusive control, prior to or at the time of the attempt by the landlord or landlord's agent to enter.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) A landlord may not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. A tenant may not unreasonably withhold consent from the landlord to enter.</li>
		<li>(3) This section does not apply to tenancies consisting of a rental of space in a facility for a manufactured dwelling or floating home under ORS 90.505 to 90.840.</li>
		<li>(4) If a tenancy consists of rented space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home that is owned by the tenant, but the tenancy is not subject to ORS 90.505 to 90.840 because the space is not in a facility, this section shall allow access only to the rented space and not to the dwelling or home.</li>
		<li>(5) A landlord has no other right of access except:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Pursuant to court order;</li>
				<li>(b) As permitted by ORS 90.410 (2); or</li>
				<li>(c) When the tenant has abandoned or relinquished the premises.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(6) If a landlord is required by a governmental agency to enter a dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant's exclusive control, but the landlord fails to gain entry after a good faith effort in compliance with this section, the landlord may not be found in violation of any state statute or local ordinance due to the failure.</li>
		<li>(7) If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access or may terminate the rental agreement under ORS 90.392 and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. In addition, the landlord may recover actual damages.</li>
		<li>(8) If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but that have the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the reoccurrence of the conduct or may terminate the rental agreement pursuant to ORS 90.360 (1). In addition, the tenant may recover actual damages not less than an amount equal to one week's rent in the case of a week-to-week tenancy or one month's rent in all other cases. [Formerly 90.335; 1997 c.577 &sect;18; 1999 c.603 &sect;19; 1999 c.676 &sect;12; 2005 c.391 &sect;20]</li>

In addition, the tenant may recover as damages from the landlord the actual and reasonable cost or fair and reasonable value of comparable substitute housing in excess of the rent for the dwelling unit. For purposes of this paragraph, substitute housing is comparable if it is of a quality that is similar to or less than the quality of the dwelling unit with regard to basic elements including cooking and refrigeration services and, if warranted, upon consideration of factors such as location in the same area as the dwelling unit, the availability of substitute housing in the area and the expense relative to the range of choices for substitute housing in the area. A tenant may choose substitute housing of relatively greater quality, but the tenant's damages shall be limited to the cost or value of comparable substitute housing.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>(1) When the tenancy is a week-to-week tenancy, by delivering to the tenant at least 72 hours' written notice of nonpayment and the landlord's intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period. The landlord shall give this notice no sooner than on the fifth day of, the rental period, including the first day the rent is due.</li>
		<li>(2) For all tenancies other than week-to-week tenancies, by delivering to the tenant:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) At least 72 hours' written notice of nonpayment and the landlord's intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period. The landlord shall give this notice no sooner than on the eighth day of the rental period, including the first day the rent is due; or</li>
				<li>(b) At least 144 hours' written notice of nonpayment and the landlord's intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period. The landlord shall give this notice no sooner than on the fifth day of the rental period, including the first day the rent is due.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(3) The notice described in this section must also specify the amount of rent that must be paid and the date and time by which the tenant must pay the rent to cure the nonpayment of rent.</li>
		<li>(4) Payment by a tenant who has received a notice under this section is timely if mailed to the landlord within the period of the notice unless:</li>

					<ul>
						<li>(A) By personal delivery as provided in ORS 90.155 (1)(a); or</li>

<p><b><span id=""c396"">90.396</span> Acts or omissions justifying termination 24 hours after notice.</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, after at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the acts and omissions constituting the cause and specifying the date and time of the termination, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168, if:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The tenant, someone in the tenant's control or the tenant's pet seriously threatens to inflict substantial personal injury, or inflicts any substantial personal injury, upon a person on the premises other than the tenant;</li>
				<li>(b) The tenant or someone in the tenant's control recklessly endangers a person on the premises other than the tenant by creating a serious risk of substantial personal injury;</li>
				<li>(c) The tenant, someone in the tenant's control or the tenant's pet inflicts any substantial personal injury upon a neighbor living in the immediate vicinity of the premises;</li>
				<li>(d) The tenant or someone in the tenant's control intentionally inflicts any substantial damage to the premises or the tenant's pet inflicts substantial damage to the premises on more than one occasion;</li>
				<li>(e)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The tenant intentionally provided substantial false information on the application for the tenancy within the past year;</li>
						<li>(B) The false information was with regard to a criminal conviction of the tenant that would have been material to the landlord's acceptance of the application; and</li>
						<li>(C) The landlord terminates the rental agreement within 30 days after discovering the falsity of the information; or</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(f) The tenant, someone in the tenant's control or the tenant's pet commits any act that is outrageous in the extreme, on the premises or in the immediate vicinity of the premises. For purposes of this paragraph, an act is outrageous in the extreme if the act is not described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection, but is similar in degree and is one that a reasonable person in that community would consider to be so offensive as to warrant termination of the tenancy within 24 hours, considering the seriousness of the act or the risk to others. An act that is outrageous in the extreme is more extreme or serious than an act that warrants a 30-day termination under ORS 90.392. Acts that are ""outrageous in the extreme"" include, but are not limited to, the following acts by a person:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Prostitution, patronizing a prostitute or promoting prostitution, as described in ORS 167.007, 167.008 and 167.012;</li>
						<li>(B) Manufacture, delivery or possession of a controlled substance, as described in ORS 475.005, but not including:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>(i) The medical use of marijuana in compliance with ORS 475.300 to 475.346;</li>
								<li>(ii) Possession of, or delivery for no consideration of, less than one avoirdupois ounce of marijuana as described in ORS 475.860 (3) or 475.864 (3); or</li>
								<li>(iii) Possession of prescription drugs;</li>
							</ul>
						<li>(C) Intimidation, as described in ORS 166.155 and 166.165; or</li>
						<li>(D) Burglary as described in ORS 164.215 and 164.225.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(2) If the cause for a termination notice given pursuant to subsection (1) of this section is based upon the acts of the tenant's pet, the tenant may cure the cause and avoid termination of the tenancy by removing the pet from the premises prior to the end of the notice period. The notice must describe the right of the tenant to cure the cause. If the tenant returns the pet to the premises at any time after having cured the violation, the landlord, after at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the subsequent presence of the offending pet, may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. The tenant does not have a right to cure this subsequent violation.</li>
		<li>(3) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, someone is in the tenant's control if that person enters or remains on the premises with the tenant's permission or consent after the tenant reasonably knows or should know of that person's act or likelihood to commit any act of the type described in subsection (1) of this section.</li>
		<li>(4) An act can be proven to be outrageous in the extreme even if the act is one that does not violate a criminal statute. Notwithstanding the references to criminal statutes in subsection (1)(f) of this section, the landlord's burden of proof in an action for possession under subsection (1) of this section is the civil standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</li>
		<li>(5) If a good faith effort by a landlord to terminate the tenancy under subsection (1)(f) of this section and to recover possession of the rental unit under ORS 105.105 to 105.168 fails by decision of the court, the landlord may not be found in violation of any state statute or local ordinance requiring the landlord to remove that tenant upon threat of fine, abatement or forfeiture as long as the landlord continues to make a good faith effort to terminate the tenancy.

<p><b><span id=""c398"">90.398</span> Termination of rental agreement for drug or alcohol violations.</b></p> 
	<ul>
		<li>(1) If a tenant living for less than two years in drug and alcohol free housing uses, possesses or shares alcohol, illegal drugs, controlled substances or prescription drugs without a medical prescription, the landlord may deliver a written notice to the tenant terminating the tenancy for cause and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. The notice must specify the acts constituting the drug or alcohol violation and state that the rental agreement will terminate in not less than 48 hours after delivery of the notice, at a specified date and time. The notice must also state that the tenant can cure the drug or alcohol violation by a change in conduct or otherwise within 24 hours after delivery of the notice.</li>
		<li>(2) If the tenant cures the violation within the 24-hour period, the rental agreement does not terminate. If the tenant does not cure the violation within the 24-hour period, the rental agreement terminates as provided in the notice.</li>
		<li>(3) If substantially the same act that constituted a prior drug or alcohol violation of which notice was given reoccurs within six months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the violation and the date and time of termination of the rental agreement. The tenant does not have a right to cure this subsequent violation. [2005 c.391 &sect;10]</li>

		<li>(1) If the tenant, in violation of the rental agreement, keeps on the premises a pet capable of causing damage to persons or property, the landlord may deliver a written notice specifying the violation and stating that the tenancy will terminate upon a date not less than 10 days after the delivery of the notice unless the tenant removes the pet from the premises prior to the termination date specified in the notice. If the pet is not removed by the date specified, the tenancy shall terminate and the landlord may take possession in the manner provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168.</li>
		<li>(2) For purposes of this section, ""a pet capable of causing damage to persons or property"" means an animal that, because of the nature, size or behavioral characteristics of that particular animal or of that breed or type of animal generally, a reasonable person might consider to be capable of causing personal injury or property damage, including but not limited to, water damage from medium or larger sized fish tanks or other personal injury or property damage arising from the environment in which the animal is kept.
		<li>(3) If substantially the same act that constituted a prior noncompliance of which notice was given under subsection (1) of this section recurs within six months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon at least 10 days' written notice specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental agreement.</li>

		<li>(2) During any absence of the tenant in excess of seven days, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit at times reasonably necessary.</li>

If the landlord fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental or if the landlord accepts the abandonment as a surrender, the rental agreement is deemed to be terminated by the landlord as of the date the landlord knows or should know of the abandonment. If the tenancy is from month to month or week to week, the term of the rental agreement for this purpose is deemed to be a month or a week, as the case may be.

A landlord may refuse to accept a rent tender that is for less than the full amount of rent owed or that is untimely.</li>
		<li>(2) A landlord may accept a partial payment of rent. The acceptance of a partial payment of rent in a manner consistent with subsection (4) of this section does not constitute a waiver under ORS 90.412 (2)(b) of the landlord's right to terminate the tenancy under ORS 90.394 for nonpayment of the balance of the rent owed.</li>
		<li>(3) A landlord and tenant may by written agreement provide that monthly rent shall be paid in regular installments of less than a month pursuant to a schedule specified in the agreement. Installment rent payments described in this subsection are not partial payment of rent for purposes of this section.</li>
		<li>(4) The acceptance of a partial payment of rent waives the right of the landlord to terminate the tenant's rental agreement under ORS 90.394 for nonpayment of rent unless:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The landlord accepted the partial payment of rent before the landlord gave a nonpayment of rent termination notice under ORS 90.394 based on the tenant's agreement to pay the balance by a time certain and the tenant does not pay the balance of the rent as agreed;</li>
						<li>(B) The landlord's notice of termination is served no earlier than it would have been permitted under ORS 90.394 had no rent been accepted; and</li>
						<li>(C) The notice permits the tenant to avoid termination of the tenancy for nonpayment of rent by paying the balance within 72 hours or 144 hours, as the case may be, or by any date to which the parties agreed, whichever is later; or</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(b) The landlord accepted a partial payment of rent after giving a nonpayment of rent termination notice under ORS 90.394 and entered into a written agreement with the tenant that the acceptance does not constitute waiver. The agreement may provide that the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168 without serving a new notice under ORS 90.394 if the tenant fails to pay the balance of the rent by a time certain.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(5) Application of a tenant's security deposit or prepaid rent to an obligation owed to a landlord in foreclosure under ORS 90.367 does not constitute a partial payment of rent.</li>

				<li>(i) If the personal property includes a recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home and if applicable, there is a lienholder or owner that has a right to claim the recreational vehicle, dwelling or home, except as provided by subsection (18) of this section.</li>

Acceptance by a landlord of such payment does not operate to create or reinstate a tenancy or create a waiver pursuant to ORS 90.412 or 90.417.</li>
		<li>(9) Except as provided in subsections (18) to (20) of this section, if the tenant, lienholder or owner of a recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home does not respond within the time provided by the landlord's notice, or the tenant, lienholder or owner does not remove the personal property within the time required by subsection (8) of this section or by any date agreed to with the landlord, whichever is later, the tenant's, lienholder's or owner's personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned.

						<li>(B) For all other personal property, the reasonable current fair market value is $1,000 or less or so low that the cost of storage and conducting a public sale probably exceeds the amount that would be realized from the sale; or</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(c) Consistent with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, sell certain items and destroy or otherwise dispose of the remaining personal property.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>(a) A buyer of the dwelling or home at a sale pursuant to subsection (10)(a) of this section, with or without consideration; or</li>
				<li>(b) A person or nonprofit organization to whom the landlord gives the dwelling or home pursuant to subsection (1)(b), (10)(b) or (11)(b) of this section.</li>
			</ul>

				<li>(a) The lienholder has foreclosed its lien on the recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home;</li>
				<li>(b) The tenant or a personal representative or designated person described in subsection (20) of this section has waived all rights under this section pursuant to subsection (26) of this section; or</li>

				<li>(a) In the case of an abandoned manufactured dwelling or floating home but not including a dwelling or home abandoned following a termination pursuant to ORS 90.429 and except as provided by subsection (20)(d) and (e) of this section, if a lienholder makes a timely response to a notice of abandoned personal property pursuant to subsections (6) and (8) of this section and so requests, a landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the lienholder providing that the dwelling or home may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 12 months. A storage agreement entitles the lienholder to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.</li>
				<li>(b) The lienholder's right to a storage agreement arises upon the failure of the tenant, owner or, in the case of a deceased tenant, the personal representative, designated person, heir or devisee to remove or sell the dwelling or home within the allotted time.</li>
				<li>(c) To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the lienholder must enter into the proposed storage agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to the lienholder. The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage agreement to the lienholder in the same manner as provided by subsection (4)(b) of this section. The landlord may include a copy of the proposed storage agreement with the notice of abandoned property required by subsection (4) of this section.

				<li>(d) The storage agreement may require, in addition to other provisions agreed to by the landlord and the lienholder, that:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The lienholder make timely periodic payment of all storage charges, as described in subsection (7)(d) of this section, accruing from the commencement of the 45-day period described in subsection (6) of this section. A storage charge may include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.532, if limited to charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if incidental to the storage of personal property. A storage charge may not be due more frequently than monthly;</li>
						<li>(B) The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no greater than for late charges described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant; and</li>
						<li>(C) The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and obligations described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(e) During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord's approval of a purchaser or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval of any purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</li>
				<li>(f)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 90 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for the termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling or home without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
						<li>(B) After a landlord gives a termination notice pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for failure of the lienholder to pay a storage charge and the lienholder corrects the violation, if the lienholder again violates the storage agreement by failing to pay a subsequent storage charge, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
						<li>(C) A lienholder may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14 days' written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the rented space if the lienholder has paid all storage charges and other charges as provided in the agreement.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(g) Upon the failure of a lienholder to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the lienholder has sold or removed the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(20) If the personal property is a manufactured dwelling or floating home and is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant and who owned the dwelling or home, this section applies, except as follows:</li>
			<ul>

					</ul>
				<li>(b) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises; and</li>
						<li>(B) Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any personal representative or designated person, if actually known to the landlord.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to any personal representative or designated person, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.</li>
				<li>(d) If a personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession of the property, such as an heir or devisee, responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided by subsection (6) of this section and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the dwelling or home may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later. A storage agreement entitles the representative or person to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property. If such an agreement is entered, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder pursuant to subsection (19) of this section until the agreement with the personal representative or designated person ends.</li>
				<li>(e) If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement, subsection (19)(c), (d) and (f)(C) of this section applies, with the representative or person having the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.</li>
				<li>(f) During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the dwelling or home, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or devisee where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord's approval for occupancy of a purchaser, heir or devisee or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee of the dwelling or home upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</li>
				<li>(g) If the representative or person violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days' written notice to the representative or person stating facts sufficient to notify the representative or person of the reason for the termination. Unless the representative or person corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling or home without further notice to the representative or person.</li>
				<li>(h) Upon the failure of a representative or person to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative or person has sold or removed the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the representative or person.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(21) If the personal property is other than a manufactured dwelling or floating home and is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant and who owned the personal property, this section applies except as follows:</li>

					<ul>
						<li>(A) An heir or devisee.</li>

				<li>(c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to the heir, devisee, personal representative, designated person or estate administrator of the department, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.</li>
				<li>(d) The landlord shall allow a person that is an heir, devisee or personal representative of the tenant, or an estate administrator of the department, to remove the personal property if the person contacts the landlord within the period provided by subsection (6) of this section, complies with the requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable evidence that the person is an heir, devisee or personal representative, or an estate administrator of the department.</li>
				<li>(e) If neither an heir, devisee nor personal representative of the tenant, nor an estate administrator of the department, contacts the landlord within the time period provided by subsection (6) of this section, the landlord shall allow removal of the personal property by the designated person of the tenant, if the designated person contacts the landlord within that period and complies with the requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable evidence that the person is the designated person.</li>
				<li>(f) A landlord who allows removal of personal property under this subsection is not liable to another person that has a claim or interest in the personal property.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(22) If a governmental agency determines that the condition of a manufactured dwelling, floating home or recreational vehicle abandoned under this section constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law and the agency determines that the hazard endangers others in the immediate vicinity and requires quick removal of the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this subsection. The landlord shall comply with all provisions of this section, except as follows:</li>

						<li>(A) The dates and deadlines in the notice for contacting the landlord and removing the property must be consistent with this subsection;</li>
						<li>(B) The notice must state that a governmental agency has determined that the property constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard and must be removed quickly; and</li>
						<li>(C) The landlord shall attach a copy of the agency's determination to the notice.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(d) If the tenant, a lienholder, owner, personal representative or designated person does not remove the property within the time allowed, the landlord or a buyer at a sale by the landlord under subsection (11) of this section shall promptly remove the property from the facility.</li>
				<li>(e) A landlord is not required to enter into a storage agreement with a lienholder, owner, personal representative or designated person pursuant to subsection (19) of this section.

			</ul>
		<li>(2) A landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method as described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(ii) of this section:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) For garbage collection and disposal, unless the pro rata apportionment is based upon the number and size of the garbage receptacles used by the tenant.</li>
				<li>(b) For water service, if the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.</li>

		<li>(5)</li>
			<ul>

		<li>(10) A landlord that provides utilities or services only to tenants of the landlord in compliance with this section and ORS 90.534 and 90.536 is not a public utility for purposes of ORS chapter 757.</li>
		<li>(11) The authority granted in this section for a utility or service provider to apply policy regarding the billing methods described in subsection (1) of this section does not authorize the utility or service provider to dictate either the amount billed to tenants or the rate at which tenants are billed under ORS 90.534 or 90.536.

		<li>(2) A utility or service charge to be assessed to a tenant under this section may consist of:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The cost of the utility or service provided to the tenant's space and under the tenant's control, as measured by the submeter, at a rate no greater than the average rate billed to the landlord by the utility or service provider, not including any base or service charge;</li>

<p><b><span id=""c537"">90.537</span> Conversion of billing method for utility or service charges.</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>(1) A landlord may unilaterally amend a rental agreement to convert a tenant's existing utility or service billing method from a method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b) to a submeter billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(c). The landlord must give the tenant not less than 180 days' written notice before converting to a submeter billing method.</li>
		<li>(2) A landlord must give notice as provided in ORS 90.725 before entering a tenant's space to install or maintain a utility or service line or a submeter that measures the amount of a provided utility or service.</li>
		<li>(3) If the cost of the tenant's utility or service was included in the rent before the conversion to submeters, the landlord shall reduce the tenant's rent on a pro rata basis upon the landlord's first billing of the tenant using the submeter method. The rent reduction may not be less than an amount reasonably comparable to the amount of the rent previously allocated to the utility or service cost averaged over at least the preceding one year. A landlord may not convert billing to a submeter method less than one year after giving notice of a rent increase, unless the rent increase is an automatic increase provided for in a fixed term rental agreement entered into one year or more before the conversion. Before the landlord first bills the tenant using the submeter method, the landlord shall provide the tenant with written documentation from the utility or service provider showing the landlord's cost for the utility or service provided to the facility during at least the preceding year.</li>
		<li>(4) A landlord that installs submeters pursuant to this section may recover from a tenant the cost of installing the submeters, including costs to improve or repair existing utility or service system infrastructure necessitated by the installation of the submeters, only as follows:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) By raising the rent, as with any capital expense in the facility, except that the landlord may not raise the rent for this purpose within the first six months after installation of the submeters; or</li>
				<li>(b) In a manufactured dwelling park, by imposing a special assessment pursuant to a written special assessment plan adopted unilaterally by the landlord. The plan may include only the landlord's actual costs to be recovered on a pro rata basis from each tenant with payments due no more frequently than monthly over a period of at least 60 months. Payments must be assessed as part of the utility or service charge. The landlord must give each tenant a copy of the plan at least 90 days before the first payment is due. Payments may not be due before the completion of the installation, but must begin within six months after completion. A new tenant of a space subject to the plan may be required to make payments under the plan. Payments must end when the plan ends. The landlord is not required to provide an accounting of plan payments made during or after the end of the plan.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(5) A landlord that converts to a submeter billing method under this section from the rent billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(i) may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submeters, convert the billing for common areas to the pro rata billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(ii) by including the change in the notice required by subsection (1) of this section. If the landlord continues to use the rent billing method for common areas, the landlord may offset against the rent reduction required by subsection (3) of this section an amount that reflects the cost of serving the common areas. If the utility or service provider cannot provide an accurate cost for the service to the common areas, the landlord shall assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed. This offset is not available if the landlord chooses to bill for the common areas using the pro rata method.</li>
		<li>(6) If storm water service and wastewater service are not measured by the submeter, a landlord that installs submeters to measure water consumption under this section and converts to a submeter billing method from the rent billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(i) may continue to recover the cost of the storm water service or wastewater service in the rent or may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submeters, convert the billing for the storm water service or wastewater service to the pro rata billing method described in ORS 90.532 (1)(b)(C)(ii) by including the change in the notice required by subsection (1) of this section. If the landlord converts the billing for the storm water service or wastewater service to the pro rata billing method, the landlord must reduce the rent to reflect that charge, as required by subsection (3) of this section.
		<li>(7) A rental agreement amended under this section shall include language that fairly describes the provisions of this section.</li>
		<li>(8) If a landlord installs a submeter on an existing utility or service line to a space or common area that is already served by that line, unless the installation causes a system upgrade, a local government may not assess a system development charge as defined in ORS 223.299 as a result of the installation.

The landlord shall make the records available to the tenant during normal business hours at an on-site manager's office or at a location agreed to by the landlord and tenant. A tenant may not abuse the right to inspect utility or service charge records or use the right to harass the landlord.</li>

					</ul>
				<li>(b) The landlord must demonstrate significant other conservation measures, including:
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Testing for leaks in common areas of the manufactured dwelling park at least annually, repairing significant leaks within a reasonable time and making test results available to tenants;</li>
						<li>(B) Testing each occupied manufactured dwelling and space for leaks without charge to a tenant occupying the dwelling at least annually and making test results available to the tenant;</li>
						<li>(C) Posting annually in any manufactured dwelling park office and in any common area evidence demonstrating that per capita consumption of water in the manufactured dwelling park is below the area average for single-family dwellings, as shown by data from the local provider of water; and</li>

					</ul>
				<li>(c) The landlord must amend the rental agreement of each tenant to describe the provisions of this subsection and subsection (4) of this section and to describe the use of the pro rata billing method with additional conservation measures. The landlord may make the amendment to the rental agreement unilaterally and must provide written notice of the amendment to the tenant at least 60 days before the amendment is effective.

				<li>(b) The landlord must give notice consistent with ORS 90.725 (3)(e) before entering the tenant's space or dwelling to test for water leaks.</li>
				<li>(c) A tenant may be required by the landlord to repair a significant leak in the dwelling found by the landlord's test. The tenant must make the necessary repairs within a reasonable time after written notice from the landlord regarding the leak, given the extent of repair needed and the season. The tenant's responsibility for repairs is limited to leaks within the tenant's dwelling and from the connection at the ground under the dwelling into the dwelling. If the tenant fails to make the repair as required, the landlord may terminate the tenancy pursuant to ORS 90.630.</li>

A termination shall include removal of the dwelling or home.</li>
		<li>(2) A landlord may not require removal of a manufactured dwelling or floating home, or consider a dwelling or home to be in disrepair or deteriorated, because of the age, size, style or original construction material of the dwelling or home or because the dwelling or home was built prior to adoption of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5403), in compliance with the standards of that Act in effect at that time or in compliance with the state building code as defined in ORS 455.010.</li>
		<li>(3) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, if the tenant's dwelling or home is in disrepair or is deteriorated, a landlord may terminate a rental agreement and require the removal of a dwelling or home by giving to the tenant not less than 30 days' written notice before the date designated in the notice for termination.</li>
		<li>(4) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) State facts sufficient to notify the tenant of the causes or reasons for termination of the tenancy and removal of the dwelling or home;</li>
				<li>(b) State that the tenant can avoid termination and removal by correcting the cause for termination and removal within the notice period;</li>
				<li>(c) Describe what is required to correct the cause for termination;</li>
				<li>(d) Describe the tenant's right to give the landlord a written notice of correction, where to give the notice and the deadline for giving the notice in order to ensure a response by the landlord, all as provided by subsection (6) of this section; and</li>
				<li>(e) Describe the tenant's right to have the termination and correction period extended as provided by subsection (7) of this section.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(5) The tenant may avoid termination of the tenancy by correcting the cause within the period specified. However, if substantially the same condition that constituted a prior cause for termination of which notice was given recurs within 12 months after the date of the notice, the landlord may terminate the tenancy and require the removal of the dwelling or home upon at least 30 days' written notice specifying the violation and the date of termination of the tenancy.</li>
		<li>(6) During the termination notice or extension period, the tenant may give the landlord written notice that the tenant has corrected the cause for termination. Within a reasonable time after the tenant's notice of correction, the landlord shall respond to the tenant in writing, stating whether the landlord agrees that the cause has been corrected. If the tenant's notice of correction is given at least 14 days prior to the end of the termination notice or extension period, failure by the landlord to respond as required by this subsection is a defense to a termination based upon the landlord's notice for termination.</li>
		<li>(7) Except when the disrepair or deterioration creates a risk of imminent and serious harm to other dwellings, homes or persons within the facility, the 30-day period provided for the tenant to correct the cause for termination and removal shall be extended by at least:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) An additional 60 days if:
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The necessary correction involves exterior painting, roof repair, concrete pouring or similar work and the weather prevents that work during a substantial portion of the 30-day period; or
						<li>(B) The nature or extent of the correction work is such that it cannot reasonably be completed within 30 days because of factors such as the amount of work necessary, the type and complexity of the work and the availability of necessary repair persons; or
						<li>(b) An additional six months if the disrepair or deterioration has existed for more than the preceding 12 months with the landlord's knowledge or acceptance as described in ORS 90.412.
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(8) In order to have the period for correction extended as provided in subsection (7) of this section, a tenant must give the landlord written notice describing the necessity for an extension in order to complete the correction work. The notice must be given a reasonable amount of time prior to the end of the notice for termination period.</li>
		<li>(9) A tenancy terminates on the date designated in the notice and without regard to the expiration of the period for which, by the terms of the rental agreement, rents are to be paid. Unless otherwise agreed, rent is uniformly apportionable from day to day.</li>
		<li>(10) This section does not limit a landlord's right to terminate a tenancy for nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394 or for other cause under ORS 90.380 (5)(b), 90.396, 90.398 or 90.630 by complying with ORS 105.105 to 105.168.</li>
		<li>(11) A landlord may give a copy of the notice for termination required by this section to any lienholder of the dwelling or home, by first class mail with certificate of mailing or by any other method allowed by ORS 90.150 (2) and (3).

		<li>(12) When a tenant has been given a notice for termination pursuant to this section and has subsequently abandoned the dwelling or home as described in ORS 90.675, any lienholder shall have the same rights as provided by ORS 90.675, including the right to correct the cause of the notice, within the 90-day period provided by ORS 90.675 (19) notwithstanding the expiration of the notice period provided by this section for the tenant to correct the cause.

						<li>(C) The proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes and assessments owed on the personal property after distribution of the proceeds pursuant to subsection (13) of this section; and</li>
						<li>(D) The landlord disposes of the personal property.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>(15) The landlord is not responsible for any loss to the tenant or lienholder resulting from storage of personal property in compliance with this section unless the loss was caused by the landlord's deliberate or negligent act. In the event of a deliberate and malicious violation, the landlord is liable for twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant or lienholder.</li>
		<li>(16) Complete compliance in good faith with this section shall constitute a complete defense in any action brought by a tenant or lienholder against a landlord for loss or damage to such personal property disposed of pursuant to this section.</li>
		<li>(17) If a landlord does not comply with this section:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The tenant is relieved of any liability for damage to the premises caused by conduct that was not deliberate, intentional or grossly negligent and for unpaid rent and may recover from the landlord up to twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant;</li>
				<li>(b) A lienholder aggrieved by the noncompliance may recover from the landlord the actual damages sustained by the lienholder. ORS 90.255 does not authorize an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising under this paragraph; and</li>
				<li>(c) A county tax collector aggrieved by the noncompliance may recover from the landlord the actual damages sustained by the tax collector, if the noncompliance is part of an effort by the landlord to defraud the tax collector. ORS 90.255 does not authorize an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising under this paragraph.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(18) The provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a tenant to the abandoned personal property also apply to any lienholder, except that the lienholder may not sell or remove the dwelling or home unless:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The lienholder has foreclosed the lien on the manufactured dwelling or floating home;</li>
				<li>(b) The tenant or a personal representative or designated person described in subsection (20) of this section has waived all rights under this section pursuant to subsection (22) of this section; or</li>
				<li>(c) The notice and response periods provided by subsections (6) and (8) of this section have expired.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(19)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Except as provided by subsection (20)(d) and (e) of this section, if a lienholder makes a timely response to a notice of abandoned personal property pursuant to subsections (6) and (8) of this section and so requests, a landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the lienholder providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 12 months. A storage agreement entitles the lienholder to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.</li>
				<li>(b) The lienholder's right to a storage agreement arises upon the failure of the tenant or, in the case of a deceased tenant, the personal representative, designated person, heir or devisee to remove or sell the dwelling or home within the allotted time.</li>
				<li>(c) To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the lienholder must enter into the proposed storage agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to the lienholder. The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage agreement to the lienholder in the same manner as provided by subsection (4)(b) of this section. The landlord may include a copy of the proposed storage agreement with the notice of abandoned property required by subsection (4) of this section. A lienholder enters into a storage agreement by signing a copy of the agreement provided by the landlord and personally delivering or mailing the signed copy to the landlord within the 60-day period.</li>
				<li>(d) The storage agreement may require, in addition to other provisions agreed to by the landlord and the lienholder, that:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The lienholder make timely periodic payment of all storage charges, as described in subsection (7)(b) of this section, accruing from the commencement of the 45-day period described in subsection (6) of this section. A storage charge may include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.532, if limited to charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if incidental to the storage of personal property. A storage charge may not be due more frequently than monthly;</li>
						<li>(B) The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no greater than for late charges imposed on facility tenants;</li>
						<li>(C) The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and obligations described in the rental agreement that the landlord currently provides to tenants as required by ORS 90.510 (4); and</li>
						<li>(D) The lienholder repair any defects in the physical condition of the personal property that existed prior to the lienholder entering into the storage agreement, if the defects and necessary repairs are reasonably described in the storage agreement and, for homes that were first placed on the space within the previous 24 months, the repairs are reasonably consistent with facility standards in effect at the time of placement. The lienholder shall have 90 days after entering into the storage agreement to make the repairs. Failure to make the repairs within the allotted time constitutes a violation of the storage agreement and the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 14 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(e) Notwithstanding subsection (7)(b) of this section, a landlord may increase the storage charge if the increase is part of a facility-wide rent increase for all facility tenants, the increase is no greater than the increase for other tenants and the landlord gives the lienholder written notice consistent with the requirements of ORS 90.600 (1).</li>
				<li>(f) During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave the property on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions of ORS 90.680. The landlord may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</li>
				<li>(g)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(D) of this subsection, if the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 90 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for the termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
						<li>(B) After a landlord gives a termination notice pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for failure of the lienholder to pay a storage charge and the lienholder corrects the violation, if the lienholder again violates the storage agreement by failing to pay a subsequent storage charge, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
						<li>(C) A lienholder may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14 days' written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the facility if the lienholder has paid all storage charges and other charges as provided in the agreement.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(h) Upon the failure of a lienholder to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the lienholder has sold or removed the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the lienholder.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(20) If the personal property is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant, this section applies, except as follows:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a tenant to the abandoned personal property shall apply to any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for the deceased tenant or any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant's death.</li>
				<li>(b) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises; and</li>
						<li>(B) Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any personal representative or designated person if actually known to the landlord.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to any personal representative or designated person, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.</li>
				<li>(d) If a personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession of the property, such as an heir or devisee, responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided by subsection (6) of this section and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later. A storage agreement entitles the representative or person to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property. If such an agreement is entered, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder pursuant to subsection (19) of this section until the agreement with the personal representative or designated person ends.</li>
				<li>(e) If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement, subsection (19)(c) to (e) and (g)(C) of this section applies, with the representative or person having the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.</li>
				<li>(f) During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the property, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or devisee where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the property on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions of ORS 90.680. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.</li>
				<li>(g) If the representative or person violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days' written notice to the representative or person stating facts sufficient to notify the representative or person of the reason for the termination. Unless the representative or person corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the representative or person.</li>
				<li>(h) Upon the failure of a representative or person to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative or person has sold or removed the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the representative or person.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(21) If a governmental agency determines that the condition of personal property abandoned under this section constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law and the agency determines that the hazard endangers others in the facility and requires quick removal of the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this subsection. The landlord shall comply with all provisions of this section, except as follows:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The date provided in subsection (6) of this section by which a tenant, lienholder, personal representative or designated person must contact a landlord to arrange for the disposition of the property must be not less than 15 days after personal delivery or mailing of the notice required by subsection (3) of this section.</li>
				<li>(b) The date provided in subsections (8) and (9) of this section by which a tenant, lienholder, personal representative or designated person must remove the property must be not less than seven days after the tenant, lienholder, personal representative or designated person contacts the landlord.</li>
				<li>(c) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be as provided in subsection (5) of this section, except that:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The dates and deadlines in the notice for contacting the landlord and removing the property must be consistent with this subsection;</li>
						<li>(B) The notice must state that a governmental agency has determined that the property constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard and must be removed quickly; and</li>
						<li>(C) The landlord shall attach a copy of the agency's determination to the notice.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(d) If the tenant, a lienholder or a personal representative or designated person does not remove the property within the time allowed, the landlord or a buyer at a sale by the landlord under subsection (11) of this section shall promptly remove the property from the facility.</li>
				<li>(e) A landlord is not required to enter into a storage agreement with a lienholder, personal representative or designated person pursuant to subsection (19) of this section.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(22)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) A landlord may sell or dispose of a tenant's abandoned personal property without complying with the provisions of this section if, after termination of the tenancy or no more than seven days prior to the termination of the tenancy, the following parties so agree in a writing entered into in good faith:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>(A) The landlord;</li>
						<li>(B) The tenant, or for an abandonment as the result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant, the personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession of the personal property, such as an heir or devisee, as described in subsection (20) of this section; and</li>
						<li>(C) Any lienholder.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>(b) A landlord may not, as part of a rental agreement, as a condition to approving a sale of property on rented space under ORS 90.680 or in any other manner, require a tenant, a personal representative, a designated person or any lienholder to waive any right provided by this section.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(23) Until personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned under subsection (9) of this section, a landlord does not have a lien pursuant to ORS 87.152 for storing the personal property.

<p><b><span id=""c680"">90.680</span> Sale of dwelling or home on rented space; duties and rights of seller, prospective purchaser and landlord.</b></p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>(1) A landlord may not deny any manufactured dwelling or floating home space tenant the right to sell a manufactured dwelling or floating home on a rented space or require the tenant to remove the dwelling or home from the space solely on the basis of the sale.</li>
		<li>(2) The landlord may not exact a commission or fee for the sale of a manufactured dwelling or floating home on a rented space unless the landlord has acted as agent for the seller pursuant to written contract.</li>
		<li>(3) The landlord may not deny the tenant the right to place a ""for sale"" sign on or in a manufactured dwelling or floating home owned by the tenant. The size, placement and character of such signs shall be subject to reasonable rules of the landlord.</li>
		<li>(4) If the prospective purchaser of a manufactured dwelling or floating home desires to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, the landlord may require in the rental agreement:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Except when a termination or abandonment occurs, that a tenant give not more than 10 days' notice in writing prior to the sale of the dwelling or home on a rented space;</li>
				<li>(b) That prior to the sale, the prospective purchaser submit to the landlord a complete and accurate written application for occupancy of the dwelling or home as a tenant after the sale is finalized and that a prospective purchaser may not occupy the dwelling or home until after the prospective purchaser is accepted by the landlord as a tenant;</li>
				<li>(c) That a tenant give notice to any lienholder, prospective purchaser or person licensed to sell dwellings or homes of the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this subsection, the location of all properly functioning smoke alarms and any other rules and regulations of the facility such as those described in ORS 90.510 (5)(b), (f), (g), (i) and (j); and</li>
				<li>(d) If the sale is not by a lienholder, that the prospective purchaser pay in full all rents, fees, deposits or charges owed by the tenant as authorized under ORS 90.140 and the rental agreement, prior to the landlord's acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a tenant.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(5) If a landlord requires a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant under subsection (4) of this section, at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser an application the landlord shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale, all as provided by ORS 90.510. The terms of the statement, rental agreement and rules and regulations need not be the same as those in the selling tenant's statement, rental agreement and rules and regulations.</li>
		<li>(6) The following apply if a landlord receives an application for tenancy from a prospective purchaser under subsection (4) of this section:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The landlord shall accept or reject the prospective purchaser's application within seven days following the day the landlord receives a complete and accurate written application. An application is not complete until the prospective purchaser pays any required applicant screening charge and provides the landlord with all information and documentation, including any financial data and references, required by the landlord pursuant to ORS 90.510 (5)(i). The landlord and the prospective purchaser may agree to a longer time period for the landlord to evaluate the prospective purchaser's application or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord's screening or admission criteria. If a tenant has not previously given the landlord the 10 days' notice required under subsection (4)(a) of this section, the period provided for the landlord to accept or reject a complete and accurate written application is extended to 10 days.</li>
				<li>(b) The landlord may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant. Reasonable cause for rejection includes, but is not limited to, failure of the prospective purchaser to meet the landlord's conditions for approval as provided in ORS 90.510 (5)(i) or failure of the prospective purchaser's references to respond to the landlord's timely request for verification within the time allowed for acceptance or rejection under paragraph (a) of this subsection. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, the landlord shall furnish to the seller and purchaser a written statement of the reasons for the rejection.</li>
				<li>(c) If a rejection under paragraph (b) of this subsection is based upon a consumer report, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1681a for purposes of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the landlord may not disclose the contents of the report to anyone other than the purchaser. The landlord shall disclose to the seller in writing that the rejection is based upon information contained within a consumer report and that the landlord may not disclose the information within the report.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(7) The following apply if a landlord does not require a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant under subsection (4) of this section or if the landlord does not accept or reject the prospective purchaser as a tenant within the time required under subsection (6) of this section:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) The landlord waives any right to bring an action against the tenant under the rental agreement for breach of the landlord's right to establish conditions upon and approve a prospective purchaser of the tenant's dwelling or home;</li>
				<li>(b) The prospective purchaser, upon completion of the sale, may occupy the dwelling or home as a tenant under the same conditions and terms as the tenant who sold the dwelling or home; and</li>
				<li>(c) If the prospective purchaser becomes a new tenant, the landlord may impose conditions or terms on the tenancy that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the seller's rental agreement only if the new tenant agrees in writing.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(8) A landlord may not, because of the age, size, style or original construction material of the dwelling or home or because the dwelling or home was built prior to adoption of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5403), in compliance with the standards of that Act in effect at that time or in compliance with the state building code as defined in ORS 455.010:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) Reject an application for tenancy from a prospective purchaser of an existing dwelling or home on a rented space within a facility; or</li>
				<li>(b) Require a prospective purchaser of an existing dwelling or home on a rented space within a facility to remove the dwelling or home from the rented space.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>(9) A tenant who has received a notice pursuant to ORS 90.632 may sell the tenant's dwelling or home in compliance with this section during the notice period. The tenant shall provide a prospective purchaser with a copy of any outstanding notice given pursuant to ORS 90.632 prior to a sale. The landlord may also give any prospective purchaser a copy of any such notice. The landlord may require as a condition of tenancy that a prospective purchaser who desires to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant must comply with the notice within the notice period consistent with ORS 90.632. If the tenancy has been terminated pursuant to ORS 90.632, or the notice period provided in ORS 90.632 has expired without a correction of cause or extension of time to correct, a prospective purchaser does not have a right to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant.</li>
		<li>(10) Except as provided by subsection (9) of this section, after a tenancy has ended and during the period provided by ORS 90.675 (6) and (8), a former tenant retains the right to sell the tenant's dwelling or home to a purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant as provided by this section, if the former tenant makes timely periodic payment of all storage charges as provided by ORS 90.675 (7)(b), maintains the dwelling or home and the rented space on which it is stored and enters the premises only with the written permission of the landlord. Payment of the storage charges or maintenance of the dwelling or home and the space does not create or reinstate a tenancy or create a waiver pursuant to ORS 90.412 or 90.417. A former tenant may not enter the premises without the written permission of the landlord, including entry to maintain the dwelling or home or the space or to facilitate a sale.

	<ul>
		<li>(1) The State of Oregon encourages affordable housing options for all Oregonians. One housing alternative chosen by many Oregonians is facility living. The Legislative Assembly finds that many facility residents would like to join together to purchase the facility in which they live in order to have greater control over the costs and environment of their housing. The Legislative Assembly also finds that current market conditions place residents at a disadvantage with other potential investors in the purchase of facilities.</li>
		<li>(2) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to encourage facility residents to participate in the housing marketplace by insuring that technical assistance, financing opportunities, notice of sale of facilities and the option to purchase facilities are made available to residents who choose to participate in the purchase of a facility.</li>

"454","454","3","HB 4038A - Myths and Misconceptions","By:  Phil Querin, Querin Law.

[Remember, MHCO’s goal with HB 4038A was not to reinvent the wheel, but to make minimal changes to the current statute, amending only that which was in need of correction or change. That was always the consensus in this effort.]


 Under HB 4038A if an owner is considering selling his/her park, he/she must notify the residents. But what does “consider” mean?  I’m afraid that if I “consider” selling my park tomorrow that I will be required to then notify the residents. This is too vague! 

False. You have misread the proposed law. It does not say you must notify the residents just because you are “considering” selling your park. It only requires notice to the residents if you decide that you want to sell your park, or if you receive an offer that you “intend to consider.” This language is exactly the same as in the current law, and given the fact that heretofore, most park owners understood it, we saw no need for a change. You and you alone have the power to decide when you want to sell your park, or whether you will “intend to consider” an offer you have received. Hopefully, when that time comes, you will know instinctually in your gut what to do. It is that decision which triggers whether you will notify the residents.

 Park owners must send a notice of opportunity to purchase to every tenant in the park. Not necessarily. 

Under HB 4038A, the park owner may send the notice to an existing resident committee if one has been formed [whose purposes includes park purchases] and the owner has met with them within the preceding 12 months. This permits those owners who do not want to give notice to all residents to encourage the creation of such a resident committee in advance. HB 4038 now provides that honest errors in giving notices will not defeat the owner’s ability to sell the park to a third party. Keep in mind that notice to all residents is required in many other parts of the landlord-tenant act, such as rent raises, utility conversions, and rules changes.

 Park owners are at risk if they can’t find all residents for the notice. For example, if a tenant is renting the home to someone else. 

This comment demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of Oregon landlord-tenant law. To be a park tenant, one must both own and live in the home.
Absentee homeowners are not “tenants,” and occupying sub-tenants are not “owners.” (See, ORS 90.100 (47)(b).) In addition, Oregon law does not require landlords to “prove” that their tenant received a notice, only that it was given. (See, ORS 90.155.)

 Residents only have to notify the owner of their “interest” and there could be some that are interested and others not. There are no minimum requirements to determine how many residents must respond. 

Correct. This approach is contained in the existing law and was retained; we do not agree that MHCO or the legislature should ever try to dictate internal governance issues for park residents.

 The park owner must give financial information to all of the residents. 

False. HB 4038A put strict controls over dissemination of basic financial information that, if requested, will be turned over to a single representative designated by the residents. There are no comparable provisions under current law permitting a single point of contact. The documents can be marked “confidential”and include a list of persons to whom the information may be shared, such as financial advisors, attorneys, etc. The designated persons may not copy the material, and must return it upon completion of the process. This is not inconsistent with current standards of practice in commercial real estate transactions, where owners market their property for sale. The current park sale law says nothing about turning over financial information. This is a mistake, since residents need it in order to frame a meaningful offer. How can the residents’ experts establish value, without knowing basic income and expense information? All standard valuation models include a cap rate and/or a gross rent multiplier for commercial income property. Without basic information, any opportunity to purchase would be a meaningless; all serious third party purchasers would require it.

 The residents can submit an offer but aren’t required to provide proof of their financial capacity to close the transaction. 

As in the current law, there is no effort to dictate the terms of the residents’ offer. Our minimalist approach and goal was not to re-invent the wheel – but to keep things simple. HB 4038A says that the owner may accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. It does not require the owner to explain why he/she is accepting or rejecting. A tenant purchase offer that makes no effort to clarify their financial bona fides [e.g. by a lender’s pre-approval letter or other confirmation of financial capacity] is likely inviting a rejection. Landlords are not required to accept or counter weak offers. However, it is my own opinion, that park owners should always treat the residents’ offer with the same seriousness as any other third-party offer.

 The park owner can always reject the offer but takes the risk of being sued with an injunction blocking any other sale. 

Welcome to the real world. Anyone can sue anyone at any time. This risk has always existed under the current park sale law, and no amount of drafting will prevent that. Again, the goal was not to radically change the current park sale law, but to clean it up and clarify it where needed. The goal was never to make it more complex. Different from the current law, HB 4038A clarifies that if the owner sells the park and records an affidavit of compliance, the buyer and title company are absolutely protected. In other words, the sale cannot be set aside. That preserves the owner’s ability to convey marketable title. Additionally,
￼2
HB 4038A makes it clear that park owners may solicit other buyers throughout this process - something not addressed under current law.

 After they have received the financial information, residents have another 15 days to either form a corporate purchase entity or associate with a non-profit purchase group. What is an “associate”? A drinking buddy? This term is too vague! 

The question is nonsensical. Current law uses this term elsewhere without objection or confusion. The word “associate” may either be used as a verb (such as “to associate with a particular group”) or a noun (as in “I’d like to introduce you to my associate”). The text of HB 4038A is clear that the term “associate” is used in the verb form. This objection is either tongue-in-cheek, or the commenter does not understand the difference between verbs and nouns.

 HB 4 0 3 8 A has taken away the Sec. 1031 exclusion from park owners. 

False. If your buyer wants to exchange into your property under IRC 1031, there are limited time frames for his/her performance. This type of transaction is still exempted from the park sale law. You do not need to notify the residents. However, HB 4038A clarifies that if you want to exchange out of your property, that side of the exchange law is not exempted. Why? Because if you follow your expert’s advice you will have pre-identified the properties you want to exchange into as required by law. Only then do you need to notify the residents of your intent to market and sell the property. You are free to negotiate with the residents as well as any other prospective buyers at the same time. You do not have to hold up your exchange transaction, so long as you follow the protocols in HB 4038A. The residents cannot “make” you give up your 1031 rights. If their offer ignores your 1031 rights you may simply reject it. There was never any reason to exclude this side of the 1031 law from the residents’ opportunity to purchase. HB 3048A merely clears up this oversight. Park owners are not disadvantaged in any respect by this change.","By:  Phil Querin, Querin Law.

"455","455","3","Phil Querin Q&A More Questions on Water Sub-Metering","Question: I have been investigating the process and costs involved with installing submeters at my 180-space community and converting to a 'submeter billing method'.  At the same time as the submeter conversion, I want begin billing for common area fees and utility bills under a 'pro rata billing method'.  As far as I understand, that scenario is covered in the statutes. Here is my dilemma: 

The local municipality doesn't charge much of anything for actual water usage...it ends up only being about $6 per month/per space to pay for all water usage in the community. The way the city gets their money is by constantly adding and increasing 'utility fees' like storm drain, public safety, etc.

After running my numbers, I am beginning to question why I even want to go to the expense of installing water meters at all, because if it just ends up raising the monthly out-of-pocket cost for my senior residents, and even If they reduce their water usage significantly, they will only be able to realistically save a dollar or two per month. 

What I would like to do instead is just begin a 'pro rata billing method' for my community electricity, garbage, natural gas and city utility fees.  I would obviously offset their rent amount commensurate with the previous 12 months' total bills. What I cannot figure out after reading the statutes is this:

Can I begin a pro rata billing method for the above mentioned items, with 180 days' written notice, WITHOUT converting to a submeter billing method at the same time?


________________________ 

ORS 90.532 (3) provides as follows:

Except as allowed by subsection (2) of this section for rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010, a landlord and tenant may not amend a rental agreement to convert water or sewer utility and service billing from a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(i) [i.e. where the charge is included in the base rent] ***  to a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(ii) [i.e. where the charge is billed separately from base rent and apportioned among the tenants on a pro rata basis as measured by a master meter]. 

The exception covered in subsection ORS 90.532(2) provides as follows:

 A landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method:
      (a) For water service, if the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.
      (b) For sewer service, if it is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.



Translating this to plain English, here is my take:

•	For rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010 you may not convert water or sewer charges from an in-rent method to a pro rata billing method except as follows:
o	Water service: If the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless you were using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all 180 spaces immediately before January 1, 2010.
o	Sewer Service: If sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, you may not convert from an in-rent method to a pro rata method, unless you were already using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all 180 spaces immediately before January 1, 2010.
•	Garbage service: You may not convert from an in-rent method to a pro rata billing method unless the pro rata apportionment is based upon the number and size of the garbage receptacles used by the tenant.  There does not appear to be any time frame limitation on this rule

Pursuant to ORS 90.534 [Allocated charges for utility or service provided directly to space or common area], if a written rental agreement so provides, you may use a pro rata billing method with a master meter and require tenants to pay you a utility or service charges (e.g. electrical and natural gas) that has been billed to you or provided directly to the tenant’s space or to a common area. However, you may not unilaterally amend an existing rental agreement to convert utility and service billing from an in-rent billing method to a pro rata billing method. It appears you could use the pro rata billing method (other than sewer and water) per above rules, only on a going forward basis with new residents.

Conclusion.  This is the best I can tell you. It is not legal advice, and based only upon my interpretation of the statutes which are quite complex. It appears that yours is a difficult situation in which water/sewer submetering will not actually help.  With the exception of garbage service, there is no easy answer. However, upon closer evaluation by your attorney, perhaps you may be able to figure out a work-around solution. Good luck!

"458","458","3","Phil Querin Q&A Tree Limb Falls On A Residents House","Question: A tree limb fell through a resident’s roof.  I told him what I believed the recently enacted state law was, but don’t know if I was thorough enough.  Under the old law, tree maintenance was the tenants’ responsibility – period; regardless of whether the landlord or tenant planted and regardless of size. The resident says I should make the space safe.  I told him to take it up with the City of Portland as I wanted to take the tree out when I first developed the property and they said I had to keep the tree.  I told the resident hat my policy had been to split the tree removal cost with the resident and he agreed.  What were my rights here? 

Answer.  Many manufactured housing communities in Oregon have large trees.  While Oregon law has imposed the duty of general tree maintenance on the residents, there is little question but that most do not have the expertise, skill or financial means to provide the type of maintenance that may be required for large older trees.  With this in mind, the MHCO encouraged the Landlord-Tenant Coalition to craft a bill that fairly and clearly allocated the responsibility for tree maintenance in a realistic manner.  Landlords are in a better position than residents to obtain and afford good liability insurance, since it is a standard cost of doing business.  Moreover, there was concern that under the existing law, some park owners might not regard the issue of tree maintenance as their problem.  In reality, however, it is.  Injury or death resulting from falling limb or tree that should have been trimmed or removed is surely going to result in potential liability to the park owner.  Accordingly, the statute allocates the risk in a more realistic and practical manner:  Normal maintenance for trees on a resident’s space remains with the resident. However, if the tree has certain features that make it a “hazard tree” then responsibility shifts to the landlord – unless the resident planted the tree.  This delineation should help both landlords and residents understand their respective responsibilities.  Here is a summary of the current law:

•	“DBH”  means  the  diameter at  breast  height,   which is  measured   as the  width of  a standing tree  at  four  and  one-half feet  above  the  ground  on the  uphill side. 
 
•	“Hazard tree”  means  a tree  that:
o	Is located  on a rented space in  a manufactured dwelling park;
o	Measures  at  least  eight  inches  DBH;  and
o	Is  considered, by  an  arborist licensed  as a  landscape  construction professional pursuant  to ORS  671.560 and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture, to pose an unreasonable risk  of causing  serious  physical  harm  or  damage  to individuals or  property in the  near  future.

2.	Habitability.  A rented space is considered uninhabitable if the landlord does not  maintain a hazard tree required by the 2013 Act. 
 
3.	Resident Duties re Trees Located on Space.  A resident shall maintain and water trees, including cleanup and removal of fallen branches  and leaves, on the  rented space for  a manufactured dwelling except  for  hazard trees. 
•	“Maintaining a  tree”  means removing or  trimming a  tree  for  the  purpose  of eliminating features of the  tree  that  cause the  tree  to  be hazardous, or  that  may  cause  the  tree to become hazardous in  the  near  future. 
•	“Removing a tree”  includes:
o	Felling and  removing the  tree;  and 
o	Grinding or removing the stump of the tree.

4.	Landlord Duties re Hazard Trees. 
•	Landlord shall maintain a hazard tree that  was not  planted by the  current resident if the landlord knows  or should know that  the  tree  is a hazard tree;
•	Landlord may  maintain a tree  on the  rented space to prevent the  tree  from  becoming  a hazard tree;
o	Must provide residents with reasonable written notice and reasonable opportunity to maintain the tree themselves.
•	Landlord has discretion to decide whether the appropriate maintenance of a hazard tree is removal or trimming.
•	Landlord is not responsible for:
o	Maintaining a tree that is not a hazard tree; or
o	Maintaining any tree for aesthetic purposes.
•	A landlord must comply with the access provisions of ORS 90.725 before entering a resident’s space to inspect or maintain a tree. [Generally, 24-hour notice. – PCQ]
•	Subject to the preceding, a resident is responsible for maintaining the non-hazard trees on the resident’s space at the resident’s expense.  
o	The  resident may  retain an  arborist licensed  as a landscape  construction professional pursuant to ORS 671.560 and certified by the International Society  of Arboriculture to inspect a tree  on  the  resident’s  space  at  the  resident’s  expense;
o	If  the  arborist determines that  the  tree  is a hazard, the  resident may:
•	Require the  landlord to  maintain the tree  as a hazard tree;  or
•	Maintain the  tree  at  the  resident’s  expense,  after providing the  landlord with reasonable  written notice  of the  proposed  maintenance and  a copy of the  arborist’s report.

5.	Tree Obstructing Removal of Home From Space. If a manufactured home cannot  be removed  from  a space without first  removing or  trimming a  tree  on  the  space,  the  owner   of  the  home may  remove  or trim the  tree  at  the  owner’s  expense,  after giving  reasonable written  notice  to the landlord, for  the  purpose  of removing the  home.
 
6.	Use of Landscape Professional.  The  landlord or  resident that   is  responsible  for  maintaining  a  tree   must  engage  a landscape  construction professional with  a  valid  landscape license  issued  pursuant to  ORS  671.560  to maintain any  tree  with a DBH  of eight  inches  or  more.

7.	 Access to Resident’s Space [ORS 90.725].
•	An “emergency” includes  but  is not  limited  to:
o	A repair problem that, unless  remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious  physical  harm  or damage  to individuals or property;
o	The presence of a hazard tree on a rented space in a manufactured dwelling park.

•	An “unreasonable time”  refers  to a time  of day,  day  of the  week  or  particular time  that conflicts  with the  resident’s  reasonable and  specific  plans  to use the  space. 
•	 “Yard   maintenance,  equipment  servicing  or  grounds   keeping” includes,   but  is  not limited to, servicing individual septic  tank  systems or  water pumps,  weeding, mowing grass and  pruning trees  and  shrubs.
•	A  landlord   or  a  landlord’s   agent  may  enter  onto  a  rented  space to:
o	Inspect or  maintain trees;
o	A  landlord or  the  landlord’s agent may  enter  a rented space solely  to  inspect  a tree  despite  a denial of consent  by the  resident if  the  landlord or the  landlord’s agent  has given  at least  24 hours’  actual notice  of the  intent to enter  to inspect  the  tree  and  the  entry occurs  at  a reasonable time. 
o	If a landlord has a report from  an  arborist licensed  as a landscape  construction professional  pursuant to ORS 671.560 and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture that  a tree  on the  rented space is a hazard tree  that  must  be maintained by the  landlord under this Act, the  landlord is not  liable  for  any  damage  or injury as a result  of the  hazard tree  if  the  landlord is unable  to gain  entry after making a good faith effort  to do so.
•	If the  resident  refuses  to  allow  lawful   access, the  landlord   may  obtain  injunctive relief to compel access or may  terminate the  rental  agreement  pursuant to ORS 90.630 (1) and  take  possession in  accordance with the Oregon eviction statutes. In addition,   the landlord   may recover actual damages.

8.	Statement of Policy.  It shall include the facility policy regarding the planting of trees on the resident’s rented space.  [See ORS 90.510] 

Conclusion.  It sounds as if your solution was a good one and everyone was satisfied with the outcome.  Your question did not specify whether the tree was a “hazard tree.”  If it was, then my question to you would have been: Did you develop a tree policy for your park?  By the fact that you’re asking this question, I assume you have none.  Even if you did, it would be hard to apply it retroactively.  With the recent snow storms of February, perhaps community owners will become more mindful of these issues.  The first order of business is to take a survey of the hazard trees, and then develop a program for safety maintenance. Lastly, of course, park owners should always have a good policy of liability insurance for $1,000,000 or more that covers this type of situation. Fortunately, no one was injured in your situation, but if so, the solution might not have been so easy.

"457","457","3","Recreational Vehicle Question and Answer with Attorney Mark Busch: Abandoned RVs","By Mark L. Busch, P.C., Attorney at Law


Question:  A mobile home park has a separate RV section.  One long-time RV resident recently moved out because of illness, but left behind his RV, which is old and in poor condition.  Does the park need to file an eviction action to clear out the space for a new tenant?  What can the park do with the RV itself?

Answer: So long as the park reasonably believes under all the circumstances that the tenant has left behind the RV with no intention of asserting any further claim to it, the park does not need to file an eviction action.  Instead, the park can treat the RV as abandoned property and issue an abandoned property notice.

The abandonment process for RVs is similar to that for abandoned mobile homes.  Under ORS 90.425, the park must issue an abandonment notice for the RV.  The notice must state that:  (a) The RV and any other property left behind is considered abandoned;  (b) The tenant or any lienholder or owner must contact the landlord within 45 days to arrange for the removal of the RV;  (c) The RV is stored at a place of safekeeping; (d) The tenant or any lienholder or owner may arrange for removal of the RV by contacting the landlord at a described telephone number or address on or before the specified date;     (e) The landlord will make the RV available for removal by appointment at reasonable times;  (f) The landlord may require payment of removal and storage charges; (g) If the tenant or any lienholder or owner fails to contact the landlord by the specified date, or after that contact, fails to remove the RV within 30 days, the landlord may sell or dispose of the RV; and, (h) If there is a lienholder or other owner of the RV, they have a right to claim it.

The park must send the notice to the tenant’s park address and any other known address for the tenant.  The park must also conduct a title search on the RV and send the notice to any listed lienholder or other owners.  The notice must be sent by regular first class mail, except that lienholders must also be sent the notice by certified mail.

The good news is that after the park issues the abandonment notice, the RV itself can be removed from the rented space to open it up for a new RV tenant.  The abandoned RV simply has to be stored in a “place of safekeeping,” such as an on-site storage lot.

Finally, if the RV remains unclaimed after the 45-day period, the park can either throw away or give away the RV if the park estimates that the current fair market value is $1,000 or less, or so low that the cost of storage and conducting an auction probably exceeds the amount that could be realized from a sale.  If the estimated value is more than $1,000, the park must hold an abandonment auction using the procedures described by the abandonment statute.  (As usual, retain experienced legal counsel if unfamiliar with the abandonment process and procedures.)

The purpose is to track down people who might be late on taxes as they are getting returned mail.  Apparently they have called 15 park owners so far seeking this information.
 
I do not know if I am violating any confidentiality or privacy rights of my tenants by providing such information.  Please let me know if it is OK to send them the information.  Park owners and members of MHCO in the county might have the same question.  Thank you.


Answer: Here is § 805(b) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act regarding communication in connection with debt collection. The following activity is prohibited:
 
""Communication with third parties. Subject to limited exceptions, without the prior consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector, or the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, or as reasonably necessary to effectuate a post-judgment judicial remedy, a debt collector may not communicate, in connection with the collection of any debt, with any person other than a consumer, his attorney, a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law, the creditor, the attorney of the creditor, or the attorney of the debt collector.""
 
The Take-Away: This law, when coupled with the general expectation of privacy that residents have, it is my opinion that a landlord should never be in the position of voluntarily disseminating personal contact information to potential creditors, or any other people for that matter – unless the tenant consents in advance.  If the debt collector issues a subpoena, that’s another story.  But until they do, landlords should avoid voluntarily complying with requests for personal information on residents. This applies regardless of whether the third party is a debt collector.

The timely delivery of written notices to park residents is essential, especially when they deal with 30-day notices.  Equally important is knowing how to calculate the applicable time periods. Here is a short primer on the current Oregon law.

How to serve a written notice: There are three acceptable methods:

 	(1) Personal delivery;
      	(2) First class mail; or
     	(3) Only it the lease/rental agreement permits for both landlord and tenant, either party may use “nail and mail.”  This allows a written notice to be sent from the landlord to the tenant by first class mail addressed to the tenant at the premises and a copy of the notice to be attached in a secure manner to the main entrance to that portion of the premises; and

Calculating the notice periods. Here are the rules:

(1) Where the time for compliance is measured in days, they are calculated by consecutive calendar days, not including the initial day of service, but including the last day until 12 Midnight of the last day. 
(2) Where the time for compliance is measured in hours, they are calculated in consecutive clock hours, beginning immediately upon service.
(3) When “nail and mail” is used for a 72-hour or 144-hour nonpayment notice, the time period for compliance begins at 11:59 p.m. the day the notice is both mailed and attached to the premises. The time period ends 72 hours or 144 hours, as the case may be, after the time started to run at 11:59 p.m. on the day of mailing.

Practice Tips.  After more than a few years in this business, I’ve accumulated some rules of thumb. They may not be for everyone, but they generally work for me.  My approach is to assume that Murphy’s Law is ever-present, so I err on the side of being too cautious.
(1)	When calculating days or hours, always add a few extra just to be safe.  Just because it’s called a “72-hour notice,” doesn’t mean you can’t add a few more hours. Same for 24-hour notices.
(2)	Don’t forget the additional 3-day period for mailing. It applies to virtually all written notices you give, from 30-day notices, to park closure notices.  I frequently add five days rather than three.
(3)	 If you’re going to serve a written notice personally, take a witness, just to avoid the possibility of the resident denying service. If someone other than the tenant comes to the door, I’d think twice about making “substituted service,” as it’s too easy for the person answering to “forget,” and you’ve now got an issue you could have avoided. I suggest finding out when the resident is returning, and come back. Never deliver the notice to a child or teenager – for obvious reasons. If they won’t answer the door, don’t think you can slip it under the door, behind the screen, or drop it in an open window.  Just go back to the office and mail it via regular mail.
(4)	Never, never, never use certified mail or any other form of delivery like UPS or Fed Ex. Always use regular first class mail.
(5)	Remember, if the written notice is properly addressed, stamped and posted, the law “presumes” receipt. While the resident can try to deny it, the “presumption” requires them to prove a reason for non-receipt, which is pretty difficult to do. I’ve never seen the argument work.   A good precaution is to obtain a certificate of mailing from the post office, which confirms that you posted the letter.
(6)	I’m not a fan of nail and mail. Unless your rental agreement permits it both ways, i.e. from landlord to tenant, and vice versa,  you should not use this method. If you’re insistent on using this method, don’t forget the 11:59 PM rule.
(7)	 Don’t forget to keep true copies of the notice.  You’ll have to attach it to eviction complaint, if the matter isn’t resolved by the notice.
(8)	“Measure twice, cut once.” In other words, calculate the number of days or hours a couple of time, just to make sure you’ve got the proper amount of time. Have someone else review it, just to make sure.

"460","460","3","Helpful Tips for 55 & Older Community Owners","By David M. Weber & M. Christine Weber

We all know it is far easier to maintain a resident than find one who will fill a vacant space within a community.  This is particularly true in 55+ communities.  To be great at resident retention, managers need to believe strongly in the lifestyle that has led many seniors to a manufactured housing way of life.  Managers must be helpful, respectful, enthusiastic and work relentlessly to continuously improve their seniors’ lifestyles.

One of the measuring sticks of great managers, as well as great regional managers, is their ability to be friendly while at the same time, keeping their eyes firmly upon the objectives of the community.  The responsibilities of property management are immense and sometimes thankless.  It is hard to believe that any of us could add another thing to our schedules to strive for better resident relations.  But we must, and we must go at it with an eager, devoted, and intense passion to be successful.  The only way to achieve this and still maintain the quality of the community is great organizational skills, resident, participation and the initiative to be creative.

No matter how large or small a community and its budget, the following simple steps will bring a community to its peak performance and create strong resident relations.

Get the Residents Involved

Make photo albums or scrapbooks of residents enjoying their community or community activities. Seniors enjoy donating photos from their past and the fun time they’ve had with neighbors or friends.  Residents can form a photography club to take pictures of all community events, funny resident situations and neighbors helping one another.  Photo clubs are a good source for pictures submitted by residents.  Volunteers can help with the collection of photos and putting together the album.  Display the album(s) proudly in the activity center or community lounge area for all to enjoy.  Managers should look through the books from time to time to ensure quality content.

Encourage residents to write positive letters or stories about the community.  Resident writings can be collected in an attractive album, which is also to be displayed in the community activity center.  When the letters have been submitted, ask if they may be used in the community newsletter.  Pick one letter a month to exhibit in an attractive picture frame under the caption, “Letter of the month” or “Why we enjoy living in this community.”

Create a journal to pass around the community (it may be a spiral notebook) for all residents to write in.  A note stating the topic should be firmly attached on the outside of the journal for all to read before inserting thoughts.  The note may ask for how long the resident has lived in the community and a short biography.  Encourage the use of photos or themselves, their families and/or pets.  The final instruction should be “When you are finished with your thoughts, please pass this on to your neighbor.  If you do not wish to be a part of this project, please call the community office, and we will pick it up.”  The notebook should be placed inside a weatherproof cover and given to the first home in the community.  Many 55+ communities have seasonal residents.  You might want to wait to start until they return, so all may participate.

If your community activity center has a television set and VCR, you can host movie matinees on adverse weather days.  Rent a latest release (within the confines of movies seniors love), make popcorn for all (no salt or butter) and offer a non alcoholic beverage.  Make sure the television is placed where everyone may comfortably view it, such as a stage as or the center of the room, and make the viewing room dark.  What other thoughtful task can one do for less than $20 that gives joy to so many residents?

Everyone loves to show off their pets, especially seniors.  Host a pet show.  Purchase certificates and first, second, third place ribbons to award.  Volunteers may acquire donations from local pet stores or other businesses to be awarded as prizes.  Use an outside volunteer to pick the winners based on show, grooming, posture and training.  Participants of local pet shows may be willing to volunteer their time to judge.

The same idea can work for a car show.  Many residents have classic cars of which they are very proud.  You may want to look in your local auto trader magazines for people who host car shows professionally.  Many communities are looking for locations to hold their shows, complete with DJs, prizes, emcees and media.  Use the same ideas from the pet show for great results.

Consider opening your clubhouse to local hobbyists.  Most cities have model train clubs, remote-control airplane clubs, coin collectors and other hobbyists who are always looking for new places to meet and show off their labors of love.  This effort provides seniors a pathway back to their childhood.

Keep yourself involved

In 55+ communities, residents are more interested in local government and have the time to help coordinate and change issues of concern.  Some merely need the leadership and backing of the property owners or managers and the knowledge of who to contact to start the ball rolling.  Cooperation of managers and residents can create great things and bond them together for the common good of everyone.

Perhaps the very best resident relations trick is getting outside the comfortable walls of the community to make changes that affect all the residents.  If there are local or state issues of concern to manufactured housing communities or their residents, they need to get involved.  Our government works for us, and is more likely to listen than it is often credited as being.  One method toward such change is finding a government official who truly cares or is up for election.  Their voters live in our communities.  Working with the government takes patience and dedication.  Although this kind of dedication may be very time consuming, in 55+ communities it is just as valuable as anything else a property manager does.

Start by reading every government mailing received.  Items come up for vote on a regular basis that often negatively affect seniors and are addressed in a public forum prior to election.  These forums are great opportunities for retirees and managers to give input toward change.  Retired residents have the knowledge, spirit and time to investigate, preparing everything it takes to help present ideas in public forums.

Read all the fine print on every utility bill.  Rates may increase and go unnoticed.  If the utility  companies are approached when proposing these changes, very often they may be overturned.  It is not hard to present options to officials devising change.  For example, in 1992 the managers of a small senior community discovered the water department offered water-leak rebates for site-built homes, but did not offer any solution to water leaks in manufactured housing communities with master meters sub-metered by the community.  

With little effort this issue was approached, and the property managers found the city water department to be very cooperative in helping to resolve this problem.  Today, a program is in place for all the residents in the city under these conditions, to receive rebates when residents have water leaks.

The same situation happened in a large Florida county.  Residents in mater-metered communities also could not receive water leak rebates.  Given the equation for determining sewer rates, when residents had leaks, the charges were exorbitant.  This seriously affected the fixed-income seniors in the county.  In 2000, because of a cooperative effort between water department, community management, and the homeowner’s association of a 55+ community, this oversight was resolved.  The effort only took a few phone calls, two meetings, a couple of faxes and the designing of a form that would work for the county and the community.  Within 30 days of the community’s first request, a program was in place for the entire county making it possible for all residents to receive rebates on water leaks.


In 1997, a county water department implemented an ideal way to dispose of waste water by a unique filtering system, then piped the filtered water throughout the county to be used for irrigation (reclaimed water).  The process cost the county millions of dollars in construction.  The county water department proposed a lengthy, complicated billing system to its customers, in the form of a “base rate.”  The proposed rate would have a devastating effect to senior residents in manufactured housing communities under the same metering conditions as described above because the master-metered system is considered “commercial”.

Many phone calls were made by two community managers, in an attempt to find someone in the water department willing to explain the complex proposal, and willing to work with the communities to lower the billing rate.  This six-month process required many meetings with the water department and a dedicated effort to get all the affected communities involved in the process.  Today, as a result of this effort, all of the manufactured housing communities in that county now have a new category for billing commercial at residential rates. This new category lowered residents’ base rate more than half of the original proposed increase.  This lower rate was a big help to set-income seniors.

Keeping the media involved

Local TV media and newspaper reporters are always looking for human-interest stories.  Every time a manager discovers a resident who has done something extraordinary, the media needs to be alerted.  This includes Senior Olympics medalists, golfers who shot holes in one, shuffleboard champions and bowlers with a 300 game or a high series.  Press releases should be sent to local papers to thank residents for special things they do in the form of “Volunteer of the Month” or “Hero of the Month.”  You might also want to invite the media to special events, such as National Night Out or other unique activities.  Not only does the media coverage give residents a terrific boost, it is the best free advertising available.

These ideas and the examples above prove dedication and cooperative efforts between managers, residents, government officials and media to preserve and enhance the lifestyle seniors worked tirelessly to earn.  What better way to thank the people who shaped our world, than to work passionately to help preserve the lifestyle for which they worked so hard.  Home is where they should feel safe, respected, cared for and appreciated.  Home is what we are to provide.

<p><b><span id=""c020"">91.020</span> Tenancies classified.</b> Tenancies are as follows: Tenancy at sufferance, tenancy at will, tenancy for years, tenancy from year to year, tenancy from month to month, tenancy by entirety and tenancy for life. The times and conditions of the holdings shall determine the nature and character of the tenancy.</p>[Amended by 1969 c.591 &sect;273]
 
<p><b><span id=""c030"">91.030</span> Tenancy by entirety or for life.</b> A tenancy by entirety and a tenancy for life shall be such as now fixed and defined by the laws of the State of Oregon. [Amended by 1969 c.591 &sect;274]</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c040"">91.040</span> Tenancy at sufferance.</b> One who comes into possession of the real estate of another lawfully, but who holds over by wrong after the termination of the term, is considered as a tenant at sufferance. No notice is required to terminate a tenancy at sufferance.</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c050"">91.050</span> Tenancy at will.</b> One who enters into the possession of real estate with the consent of the owners, under circumstances not showing an intention to create a freehold interest, is considered a tenant at will. When the rent reserved in the lease at will is payable at periods of less than three months, a notice to terminate the tenancy is sufficient if it is equal to the interval between the times of payment of rent. The notice to terminate a tenancy at will is sufficient if given for the prescribed period prior to the expiration of the period for which, by the terms of the lease and holding, rents are to be paid.</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c060"">91.060</span> Tenancy from year to year.</b> One who enters into the possession of real estate with the consent of the owner, and no certain time is mentioned, but an annual rent is reserved, is considered a tenant from year to year. A notice to terminate a tenancy from year to year is sufficient if it is given 60 days prior to the expiration of the period for which, by the terms of the lease and holding, rents are to be paid.</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c070"">91.070</span> Tenancy from month to month.</b> One who holds the lands or tenements of another, under the demise of the other, and no certain time has been mentioned, but a monthly rental has been reserved, is considered a tenant from month to month. Except as otherwise provided by statute or agreement, such tenancy may only be terminated by either the landlord or tenant giving the other, at any time during the tenancy, not less than 30 days' notice in writing prior to the date designated in the notice for the termination of the tenancy. The tenancy shall terminate on the date designated and without regard to the expiration of the period for which, by the terms of the tenancy and holding, rents are to be paid.</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c080"">91.080</span> Termination when expiration of tenancy fixed by terms of lease.</b> A tenant entering into the possession of real estate may, by the terms of the lease, fix the date of expiration of the tenancy, and when so fixed, no notice is required to render the holding of the tenant wrongful and by force after the expiration of the term as fixed by the lease.</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c090"">91.090</span> Termination of tenancy by failure to pay rent; reinstatement.</b> The failure of a tenant to pay the rent reserved by the terms of the lease for the period of 10 days, unless a different period is stipulated in the lease, after it becomes due and payable, operates to terminate the tenancy. No notice to quit or pay the rent is required to render the holding of such tenant thereafter wrongful; however, if the landlord, after such default in payment of rent, accepts payment thereof, the lease is reinstated for the full period fixed by its terms, subject to termination by subsequent defaults in payment of rent.</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c100"">91.100</span> Waiver of notice.</b> Any person entering into the possession of real estate under written lease, as the tenant of another, may, by the terms of the lease of the person, waive the giving of any notice prescribed by ORS 91.050 to 91.070.</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c110"">91.110</span> Notices to be in writing; how served.</b> All notices required by ORS 91.050 to 91.070 and by ORS 105.120, must be in writing and must be served upon the tenant by being delivered to the tenant in person or by being posted in a conspicuous place on the leased premises in case of the absence of the tenant, or by being left at the residence or place of abode.</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c115"">91.115</span> Tenant not to deny landlord's title.</b> A tenant is not permitted to deny the title of the tenant's landlord at the time of the commencement of the relation. [1981 c.892 &sect;85]</p>
 
<h3>EVICTION OF NONTENANTS</h3>
 
<p><b><span id=""c120"">91.120</span> Eviction of employee; notice required.</b> An employee described in ORS 90.110 (7) may only be evicted pursuant to ORS 105.105 to 105.168 after at least 24 hours' written notice of the termination of employment or a notice period set forth in a written employment contract, whichever is longer. This section does not create the relationship of landlord and tenant between a landlord and such employee. [1987 c.611 &sect;3; 1997 c.577 &sect;29; 2001 c.596 &sect;41]</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c122"">91.122</span> Occupancy of dwelling unit by employee of resident of dwelling unit.</b></p> 

	<ul>
		<li>(1) As used in this section, ""dwelling unit"" has the meaning given that term in ORS 90.100.</li>
		<li>(2) An employee of a resident of a dwelling unit whose occupancy is conditional upon employment in and about the premises, and members of the employee's household, may only be evicted pursuant to ORS 105.105 to 105.168 after at least 24 hours' written notice of the termination of employment or a notice period set forth in a written employment contract, whichever is longer.</li>
		<li>(3) This section does not create the relationship of landlord and tenant between the resident and the employee or members of the employee's household. [Formerly 105.117]</li>
	</ul>

<p><b><span id=""c125"">91.125</span></b> [1987 c.611 &sect;5; repealed by 1993 c.369 &sect;39]</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c130"">91.130</span> Eviction of purchaser or seller of property; notice required.</b> A dwelling unit purchaser or seller described in ORS 90.110 (2) may only be evicted pursuant to ORS 105.105 to 105.168 after at least 24 hours' written notice of the termination of the occupancy or a notice period set forth in a written agreement of sale, whichever is longer. This section does not create the relationship of landlord and tenant between the seller and purchaser. [2001 c.596 &sect;2]</p>
 
<h3>RENT</h3>
 
<p><b><span id=""c210"">91.210</span> Rents payable in advance unless otherwise agreed; demand unnecessary.</b> Unless otherwise expressly provided by the lease or terms of holding, all rents reserved under the lease or terms of holding are due and payable in advance. The tenant shall pay or tender payment thereof on or prior to the first day of the rent paying period provided in the lease or by the terms of the holding, and no demand therefor is necessary to render a tenant in default.</p>
 
<p><b><span id=""c220"">91.220</span> Tenant in possession liable for rent; remedies for recovery.</b></p> 
	  
	<ul>
		<li>(1) Every person in possession of land out of which any rent is due, whether it was originally demised in fee, or for any other estate of freehold, or for any term of years, is liable for the amount or proportion of rent due from the land in possession of the person, although it is only a part of what was originally demised.</li>
		<li>(2) Such rent may be recovered in an action at law, and the deed of demise, or other instrument in writing, if there is any, showing the provisions of the lease, may be used in evidence by either party to prove the amount due from the defendant.</li>
		<li>(3) This section shall not deprive landlords of any other legal remedy for the recovery of their rents, whether secured to them by their leases or provided by law.</li>
	</ul>
 
<p><b><span id=""c225"">91.225</span> Local rent control prohibited; exclusions; exceptions.</b></p> 
	  
	<ul>
		<li>(1) The Legislative Assembly finds that there is a social and economic need to insure an adequate supply of affordable housing for Oregonians. The Legislative Assembly also finds that the imposition of general restrictions on housing rents will disrupt an orderly housing market, increase deferred maintenance of existing housing stock, lead to abandonment of existing rental units and create a property tax shift from rental-owned to owner-occupied housing. Therefore, the Legislative Assembly declares that the imposition of rent control on housing in the State of Oregon is a matter of statewide concern.</li>
		<li>(2) Except as provided in subsections (3) to (5) of this section, a city or county shall not enact any ordinance or resolution which controls the rent that may be charged for the rental of any dwelling unit.</li>
		<li>(3) This section does not impair the right of any state agency, city, county or urban renewal agency as defined by ORS 457.035 to reserve to itself the right to approve rent increases, establish base rents or establish limitations on rents on any residential property for which it has entered into a contract under which certain benefits are applied to the property for the expressed purpose of providing reduced rents for low income tenants. Such benefits include, but are not limited to, property tax exemptions, long-term financing, rent subsidies, code enforcement procedures and zoning density bonuses.</li>
		<li>(4) Cities and counties are not prohibited from including in condominium conversion ordinances a requirement that, during the notification period specified in ORS 100.305, the owner or developer may not raise the rents of any affected tenant except by an amount established by ordinance that does not exceed the limit imposed by ORS 90.493.</li>
		<li>(5) Cities, counties and state agencies may impose temporary rent controls when a natural or man-made disaster that materially eliminates a significant portion of the rental housing supply occurs, but must remove the controls when the rental housing supply is restored to substantially normal levels.</li>
		<li>(6) As used in this section, ""dwelling unit"" and ""rent"" have the meaning given those terms in ORS 90.100.</li>
		<li>(7) This section is applicable throughout this state and in all cities and counties therein. The electors or the governing body of a city or county shall not enact, and the governing body shall not enforce, any ordinance, resolution or other regulation that is inconsistent with this section. [1985 c.335 &sect;2; 2007 c.705 &sect;3]</li>
	</ul>
 
<h3>EMBLEMENTS</h3>
 
<p><b><span id=""c230"">91.230</span> Farm tenant's right to emblements.</b> When the leasing or occupation is for the purpose of farming or agriculture, the tenant or person in possession shall, after the termination of the lease or occupancy, have free access to the premises to cultivate and harvest or gather any crop or produce of the soil planted or sown by the tenant or person in possession before the service of notice to quit. [Formerly 91.310]</p>
 
<h3>MATTERS RELATING TO GAMBLING LEASES</h3>
 
<p><b><span id=""c240"">91.240</span> Gambling leases prohibited; status of rental contracts; termination; recovery of possession.</b></p> 
	  
	<ul>
		<li>(1) No person shall let or rent any house, room, shop or other building, or any boat, booth, garden or other place, knowing or having reason to believe it will be used for gambling purposes.</li>
		<li>(2) All contracts for the rent of a room, building or place in violation of subsection (1) of this section are void between the parties.</li>
		<li>(3) Any person letting or renting any room, building, or place mentioned in subsection (1) of this section which is at any time used by the lessee or occupant thereof, or any other person with the knowledge or consent of the lessee or occupant, for gambling purposes, upon discovery thereof, may avoid and terminate such lease or contract of occupancy, and recover immediate possession of such building or other place by an action at law for that purpose to be brought before any justice of the peace of the county in which the use is permitted. [Formerly 91.410]</li>
	</ul>
 
<p><b><span id=""c245"">91.245</span> Penalty for letting or renting a place for gambling purposes.</b> Violation of ORS 91.240 (1) results in a forfeiture of twice the amount of the rent of such building or other place for six months to be recovered by action at law instituted by the district attorney in the name of the state. [Formerly 91.420]</p>
 
<h3>UTILITY CLAIMS</h3>
 
<p><b><span id=""c255"">91.255</span> Transfer of claim; prohibition; limitations.</b></p> 
	  
	<ul>
		<li>(1) As used in this section, ""municipal utility"" means any city, county or district that provides or delivers electricity, natural gas, domestic water, sewer service or garbage or refuse service. A ""municipal utility"" does not include a people's utility district.</li>
		<li>(2) A utility company shall not transfer a claim against a tenant to the owner of the real property without the written consent of the owner.</li>
		<li>(3) A municipal utility shall not transfer a claim against a tenant to the owner of the real property unless the municipal utility provided notice of the delinquent status to the tenant and mailed a copy of the notice of delinquency by first class mail to the last address of the owner or owner's agent that is on file with the utility, within 30 days from the time the payment is due on the account.</li>
		<li>(4) A municipal utility shall not deny or shut off its service to any subsequent tenant based on any lien for an unpaid claim for services furnished to a previous tenant who has vacated the premises unless the utility notified the owner or the owner's agent of any delinquency by mailing a copy of the notice of delinquency by first class mail to the last address of the owner or owner's agent that is on file with the utility, at the time the notice was sent to the previous tenant.</li>
		<li>(5) A municipal utility may not provide service to a tenant if the tenant has a previous unpaid bill with the municipal utility unless that municipal utility and tenant agree to a plan for repayment of unpaid utility bills.</li>
		<li>(6) A municipal utility shall have the same policy regarding the disconnection of services for nonpayment of an outstanding amount for a single family residence occupied by a tenant and for a single family residence occupied by the owner.</li>
		<li>(7) A municipal utility shall provide information to the owner or owner's agent regarding the status of a tenant's account upon request, within a reasonable amount of time. If a request is made verbally, the municipal utility shall provide the information verbally. If a municipal utility discloses information under this subsection, the municipal utility shall not be held responsible for the disclosure of information to a person who is not an owner or owner's agent.</li>
		<li>(8) Subsections (5) and (6) of this section apply only if a municipal utility intends to file a lien for unpaid utility services or intends to deny service to a subsequent tenant based on a claim for unpaid services to a previous tenant.</li>
		<li>(9) Subsection (7) of this section applies only if a municipal utility intends to file a lien for unpaid utility services or intends to deny service to a subsequent tenant based on a claim for unpaid services to a previous tenant.</li>
		<li>(10) Nothing in this section creates, expands or abridges any authority of a municipal utility to transfer a claim, based upon any contract, ordinance or lien.</li>
		<li>(11) Nothing in this section shall abridge any procedural due process protections such as notice and hearing that a tenant or subsequent tenant is entitled to under a contract, utility policy, rule, statute or the state and federal Constitutions, prior to the denial or shutoff of service. [1987 c.611 &sect;1; 1993 c.786 &sect;1]</li>

"465","465","3","Americans With Disabilities Revised Requirements - Service Animals ","The Department of Justice published revised final regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for title II (State and local government services) and title III (public accommodations and commercial facilities) on September 15, 2010, in the Federal Register. These requirements, or rules, clarify and refine issues that have arisen over the past 20 years and contain new, and updated, requirements, including the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards). 

Overview

This publication provides guidance on the term “service animal” and the service animal provisions in the Department’s revised regulations. 

■ Beginning on March 15, 2011, only dogs are recognized as service animals under titles II and III of the ADA. 

■ A service animal is a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability. 

■ Generally, title II and title III entities must permit service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas where members of the public are allowed to go.

How “Service Animal” Is Defined

Service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with dis¬abilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pull¬ing a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person’s disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA. 

This definition does not affect or limit the broader definition of “assistance animal” under the Fair Housing Act or the broader definition of “service animal” under the Air Carrier Access Act.

Some State and local laws also define service animal more broadly than the ADA does. Information about such laws can be obtained from that State’s attorney gen¬eral’s office.

Where Service Animals Are Allowed

Under the ADA, State and local governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is normally allowed to go. For example, in a hospital it would be inappropriate to exclude a service animal from areas such as patient rooms, clinics, cafeterias, or examination rooms. However, it may be appropriate to exclude a service animal from operating rooms or burn units where the animal’s presence may compro¬mise a sterile environment.

Service Animals Must Be Under Control

Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal’s work or the individual’s disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.

Inquiries, Exclusions, Charges, and Other Specific Rules Related to Service Animals

■ When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person’s disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.

■ Allergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals. When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.

■ A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or (2) the dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal’s presence.

■ Establishments that sell or prepare food must allow service animals in public areas even if state or local health codes prohibit animals on the premises.

■ People with disabilities who use service animals cannot be isolated from other patrons, treated less favorably than other patrons, or charged fees that are not charged to other patrons without animals. In addition, if a business requires a deposit or fee to be paid by patrons with pets, it must waive the charge for service animals.

■ If a business such as a hotel normally charges guests for damage that they cause, a customer with a disability may also be charged for damage caused by himself or his service animal.

■ Staff are not required to provide care or food for a service animal.

Miniature Horses

In addition to the provisions about service dogs, the Department’s revised ADA regula¬tions have a new, separate provision about miniature horses that have been individu¬ally trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. (Miniature horses generally range in height from 24 inches to 34 inches measured to the shoulders and generally weigh between 70 and 100 pounds.) Entities covered by the ADA must modify their policies to permit miniature horses where reasonable. The regulations set out four assessment factors to assist enti¬ties in determining whether miniature horses can be accommodated in their facility.

"466","466","3","Americans With Disabilities 2010 Revised Requirements - Service Animals ","The Department of Justice published revised final regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for title II (State and local government services) and title III (public accommodations and commercial facilities) on September 15, 2010, in the Federal Register. These requirements, or rules, clarify and refine issues that have arisen over the past 20 years and contain new, and updated, requirements, including the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards).

Overview

This publication provides guidance on the term “service animal” and the service animal provisions in the Department’s revised regulations.

■ Beginning on March 15, 2011, only dogs are recognized as service animals under titles II and III of the ADA.

■ A service animal is a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability.

■ Generally, title II and title III entities must permit service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas where members of the public are allowed to go.

How “Service Animal” Is Defined

Service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with dis¬abilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pull¬ing a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person’s disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.

This definition does not affect or limit the broader definition of “assistance animal” under the Fair Housing Act or the broader definition of “service animal” under the Air Carrier Access Act.

Some State and local laws also define service animal more broadly than the ADA does. Information about such laws can be obtained from that State’s attorney gen¬eral’s office.

Where Service Animals Are Allowed

Under the ADA, State and local governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is normally allowed to go. For example, in a hospital it would be inappropriate to exclude a service animal from areas such as patient rooms, clinics, cafeterias, or examination rooms. However, it may be appropriate to exclude a service animal from operating rooms or burn units where the animal’s presence may compro¬mise a sterile environment.

Service Animals Must Be Under Control

Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal’s work or the individual’s disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.

Inquiries, Exclusions, Charges, and Other Specific Rules Related to Service Animals

■ When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person’s disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.

■ Allergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals. When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.

■ A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or (2) the dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal’s presence.

■ Establishments that sell or prepare food must allow service animals in public areas even if state or local health codes prohibit animals on the premises.

■ People with disabilities who use service animals cannot be isolated from other patrons, treated less favorably than other patrons, or charged fees that are not charged to other patrons without animals. In addition, if a business requires a deposit or fee to be paid by patrons with pets, it must waive the charge for service animals.

■ If a business such as a hotel normally charges guests for damage that they cause, a customer with a disability may also be charged for damage caused by himself or his service animal.

■ Staff are not required to provide care or food for a service animal.

Miniature Horses

In addition to the provisions about service dogs, the Department’s revised ADA regula¬tions have a new, separate provision about miniature horses that have been individu¬ally trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. (Miniature horses generally range in height from 24 inches to 34 inches measured to the shoulders and generally weigh between 70 and 100 pounds.) Entities covered by the ADA must modify their policies to permit miniature horses where reasonable. The regulations set out four assessment factors to assist enti¬ties in determining whether miniature horses can be accommodated in their facility. The assessment factors are (1) whether the min¬iature horse is housebroken; (2) whether the miniature horse is under the owner’s control; (3) whether the facility can accommodate the miniature horse’s type, size, and weight; and (4) whether the miniature horse’s pres¬ence will not compromise legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operation of the facility.","The Department of Justice published revised final regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for title II (State and local government services) and title III (public accommodat",,"1395074612","2"
"468","468","3","Screening Criteria - Essential to Application Process and Preserving Your Role as the Gate Keeper for Your Community","Your “Screening Criteria” is another important document that should be provided to an interested applicant. This is the document that will determine where you draw the line between acceptance and denial. Your “Screening Criteria” is a written statement of the factors the landlord considers in deciding whether to accept of reject an applicant and any qualification required for acceptance. What can you have on that list? That is up to you.

Here is a brief list to get you started: unsatisfactory rental references, the absence of any prior tenant history or credit history, unsatisfactory character references, criminal history, bankruptcy filed in the past two years, payment of rent problems, no social security number, and inaccurate information on the application, insufficient debt to income ratio. All of these are reasons for denial – it is up to you establish them as a basis for acceptance into you community. For example – maybe you accept applicants with felony conviction that are 20 years or older – it is up to you to include that on your screening criteria.

Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications. Do not make exceptions! The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case. Save yourself the agony of these situations – write a “screening criteria” and apply it uniformly. Used properly and consistently it can be a tool that keeps you above any suspicion of discrimination. The one limit on your screening criteria is that you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or sources of income. However, you can deny tenancy to anyone – even if they are in a protected class – if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria that you establish in your screening criteria. Often potential applicants will “self screen” themselves by reading your “screening criteria” and realizing that they do not qualify, thus saving you and the potential applicant time and energy.

Screening/Admission Criteria: All applicants should be presented with a full explanation of the established basis for acceptance or rejection. This should be a written statement of any factors a landlord considers in deciding whether to accept or reject an applicant and any qualifications required for acceptance - in many cases MHCO Form 10 and 10A would be applicable. This may include:

•	Unsatisfactory rental references
•	Applicant must be 18 years or older
•	Provide two pieces of identification, one with each applicant’s photo from a government office (i.e. Driver’s License, State ID Card, Passport) and Social Security Card
•	Be gainfully employed or have verifiable income from retirement, social security or periodic income.
•	If the community is a “age 55 or older” or an “age 62 or older” Community, you must provide proof that you meet the age requirements
•	The absence of any prior tenant history or credit history
•	Unsatisfactory credit history
•	Unsatisfactory character references
•	Any criminal history
•	Insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly rental and other expense obligations (Remember - you cannot deny them based on Section 8 assistance)
•	Presence of pets or the number, type or size of pets
•	Evidence that the prospective tenant has provided landlord with falsified or materially misleading information on any material items
•	If the prospective tenant refuses to sign a new written rental agreement or lease agreement
•	The number of additional occupants
•	Adverse information contained in the public record

Additional criteria that may be added to qualify could include:

•	Minimum two-year verifiable references with previous landlords
•	No payment of rent problems over the past two years
•	Two years of verifiable employment
•	No criminal convictions
•	No tax liens
•	Sufficient income to pay all outstanding obligations after payment of rent
•	Any individual who is a current illegal substance abuser, or has been convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance will be denied tenancy
•	Any individual or pet/animal whose residency would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals.
•	If pets are permitted they must meet the requirements of state and local laws, ordinances, and the Community in regards to number, size and breed. Farm animals, exotic and/or wild animals, livestock and certain breeds of dogs. You should list breeds of dogs that are not allowed in your community
•	You may want to set a percentage of net-income that should be left over after meeting all financial obligations.
•	Homes must be owner occupied – no subleasing

You MUST post your community’s screening criteria publicly in the office and provide written copies to all prospective residents.

Remember to apply your criteria uniformly in all applications. Do not make exceptions! Once you make an exception for one of your criteria you are opening up the possibility of future problems. You will be in the awkward position of having to explain why you made the exception to one applicant and not to another applicant. The question of whether you denied one person and accepted another could be tied to a potential discrimination case. Save yourself the agony of these situations and do not make exceptions to your screening criteria. Take the time to put your screening criteria in writing to protect yourself and provide prospective residents with a copy so that they can have the necessary information upon which to make a decision.

Remember – you cannot deny residency to anyone because of his or her race, color, religion, sex, handicapped status, familial status, national origin or source of income. However, you can deny tenancy to anyone – even if they are in a protected class – if they do not meet any of the minimum criteria.
For example: If someone applies for a space in your park and reveals that they are Catholic and have a bad credit record you cannot deny tenancy based on the fact that the individual is Catholic. However, you may deny the tenancy based on the fact that the prospective tenant has bad credit so long as the minimum screening criteria have been consistently applied.

Tell the applicant that you require a certain amount of time to screen the completed application, but that they will be notified within seven days, in accordance with Oregon law. This will give you the opportunity to complete credit and criminal checks, determine the condition of the home for pre-sale or move-in requirements, check employment and personal references; and get information about current and past tenancies.

Example: Landlord/Community
Screening or Admission Criteria

"469","469","3","Phil Querin Q&A Selling New Manufactured Home for Community Sales","Question.  As a park, we would like to purchase new manufactured homes to fill vacant lots.  We would purchase them from the manufacturer, set them up, and probably list them through a real estate agent for the marketing.  We would not handle the financing, especially under the complicated Dodd-Frank stuff, which would require the prospective purchaser to seek their own means of coming up with the funds to make the purchase.  We would not “carry the paper.”  We assume that the real estate people are either MLO's themselves, or can point a prospective purchaser into the direction of a MLO. At this point, we believe that we have the financial portion on our side figured out, but run into a couple of legal questions that you may be able to help us with.
 
Today, I contacted the Oregon Division of Finance & Corporate Securities asking what type of Manufactured Structures Dealer (“MSD”) license we would need to purchase new homes from a dealer and resell them within our park.  He explained that the Limited MSD license would suffice.  I told him that I had read that the limited MSD license authorized the selling of no more than 10 pre-owned manufactured structures during a calendar year, and that my understanding is only abandoned structures and dwellings purchased by the licensee and sited at the licensee’s park at the time of sale fit under the LMSD license.  I asked him if the sale of the structure “sited in the park” meant that when the park owner re-sold the unit the home was required to be sited in the park, or when the park owner purchased the home from the manufacturer the home needed to be already within the park.  He told me that that was a good question that no one had asked before but still felt that a LMSD license would be okay. 
 
Upon further checking I see that a MSD (not a Limited MSD) allows a business holding that license to sell new and used manufactured structures.  Our questions are as follows:
•	What type of a Manufactured Structure License would we need to sell new homes that we have purchased from a dealership or manufacturer? 
•	 Can we as park even hold a MSD License? 
•	Would our idea of placing the marketing of the home into the hands of a real estate agent release us from having to become or hire an independent MLO? 

Answer:  The following answers should not be regarded as “legal advice” since this column is intended to be purely educational and for general information purposes. You need to consult your own attorney for a legal opinion.   

•	You are correct about the law; the limited dealer’s license is just for park owners with abandoned homes.  There is no provision for dealers with a limited license to sell new homes. According to the law, you need a regular dealer’s license. See, ORS 446.696,  446.701  and 446.706. 
•	I am troubled that the DFCS said they thought it was OK for you to sell new homes under a limited license, since limited licenses are for abandoned homes which are (presumably) pre-owned.  Having said that, if you wanted to proceed on the DFCS’s advice, I suspect that if some official later objected, they would have a hard time taking any punitive measures you’re your noncompliance.  Of course, you never know. The IRS gives out information all the time, and following their advice is no defense to a violation.  Why don’t you ask if they will put their verbal statement in writing?
•	I agree that the law says a dealer under a regular license (as opposed to a limited license) may sell new and used homes (so long as he/she discloses that they will sell used homes in the application). 
•	Note that you do not need a MLO license to sell homes. You may use a real estate broker to list and sell your new homes.  The fact that they are sited at your park and later sold does not make them “resales.”  However, to offer or negotiate the financing terms of a purchase money loan, you would need the services of an Oregon licensed MLO (i.e.  a mortgage broker or mortgage banker). The real estate brokers can handle the transaction, write it up, etc., but cannot advertise or negotiate specific financial terms were you to carry the paper. 
•	However, if you are going to require that the buyers secure their own financing (i.e. you are not going to “carry the paper”), I see no reason that you need to worry about MLOs, since you will be selling for cash.  You will not be taking payments over time.  It will be the buyer’s lender who will be acting as the MLO (i.e. the mortgage broker or mortgage banker), and negotiating the terms of the purchase money loan to the buyer.  
•	My reading of Oregon administrative rule 441-446-0203 prohibits dealers from acquiring an ownership interest in a park only appears to apply if you are going to offer or negotiate the terms of a residential mortgage loan, i.e. engage in MLO activities or are doing so under an exemption under the MLO laws. Since buyer financing is going to occur via third-party lenders, I do not believe you are prohibited as a “dealer” from owning an interest in a manufactured housing community. 
•	From my perspective, you would be much safer to have someone with a full dealer’s license handle the sales program. The real estate licensee can list the homes, find the buyers, write up the transactions (making them subject to third-party financing, etc.). The dealer can handle the transaction from there.

Footnote 2: 446.701 Issuance of temporary manufactured structure dealer license. (1) If a licensed manufactured structure dealer dies or becomes incapacitated, the Department of Consumer and Business Services may issue a temporary manufactured structure dealer license to the executor, administrator or personal representative of the estate of the dealer or to an agent of the dealer approved by the department. A temporary license issued under this subsection expires after six months, but the department may extend the license for good cause. The department may not extend a temporary license if the license has been suspended or the licensee placed on probation by the department.
      (2) A person issued a temporary manufactured structure dealer license must deliver to the department a bond or letter of credit that meets the requirements under ORS 446.726. A bond or letter of credit covering a license term of less than one year must be for the sum otherwise required for each year a license is valid and must be renewed if the term is extended. The temporary manufactured structure dealer is responsible for ensuring that, during the term of the temporary license, the dealership and its employees comply with ORS 446.661 to 446.756. and rules adopted thereunder. This subsection does not relieve a manufactured structure dealer licensed under ORS 446.691 or 446.696 from liability for a violation arising out of actions or omissions by the dealer.
      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 446.731:
      (a) Issuance of a temporary manufactured structure dealer license does not, by itself, affect the rights or interests of any creditors of the dealer in dealership assets or inventory.
      (b) Issuance or expiration of a temporary license is not a transfer of interest for purposes of ORS 446.736.
      (4) A person obtaining a temporary manufactured structure dealer license must pay the applicable fee specified in ORS 446.721 for issuance of a temporary manufactured structure dealer license. [2003 c.655 §29a]

      (c) Pays the fee specified in ORS 446.721 for renewal of a limited manufactured structure dealer license. [2003 

","Question.  As a park, we would like to purchase new manufactured homes to fill vacant lots.",,"1395678519","2"
"470","470","3","55 & Older Community Reminder: Make Sure Your Re-Survey Is Current","We all know that 80% or more of a community homesites must be occupied by at least one 55+ person, and that documented proof of age must be consistently required to qualify for 55+ status under HOPA.  Let’s not forget that the requirements also mandate the re-survey.

What do the Regulations say?  “…The procedures described in paragraph (b) [routinely determining the occupancy of each unit, including the identification of whether at least one occupant of each unit is 55 years of age or older] … must provide for regular updates, through surveys or other means, of the initial information supplied by the occupants of the housing facility or community.  Such updates must take place once every two years ….”

The comments behind the regulations clarify the duties required of the housing provider.  HUD received many objections to the regulations imposing a continuing duty of providing a “census” or re-verification of a park’s “older persons” (55+ years of age) status.  HUD’s responses help us understand the duties of maintaining a qualified “older persons” community.

For example, there were objections to the re-survey mandate on the grounds it was too burdensome.  HUD stated that owners would not be unduly burdened by the update requirements since the information “will be readily available in the files.”

This comment reflects that the survey requirement can be fulfilled by preparation of a summary of names and ages of the homeowners based on existing file information (assuming the files are up to date).  One might annotate a rent roll with resident ages and satisfy the requirement.  HUD emphasizes that “…the re-survey does not require that all supporting documents be collected again – only that the community confirm that those persons counted as occupying dwellings for purposes of meeting the 80% requirement are, in fact, still in occupancy.”

It is also clear that the survey is a “summary” and not required to include underlying documentation (remember the POA must be obtained for approval of tenancy and kept in the resident’s file): “[Only the overall survey summary is required to be available for review, not the supporting documentation.  The word ‘summary’ has been added to this section”).

Compilation of the “Summary”

In review of the files to compile the required “summary,” it is possible that some files may be missing POA documentation.  Missing POA reflects inconsistent conformance to a required age verification policy.  This can be fatal to defending a “55+” status.  Yet, there are plausible reasons why POA may be absent.  Perhaps a resident’s tenancy commenced before the date of enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (September 12, 1988): this was the last date to “grandfather” underage residents excluded from the calculation of the 80-20 requirement; perhaps the Xerox copier did not work on the day identification was checked; perhaps the applicant’s age was so obvious that documentation was overlooked; perhaps the POA was misplaced.  None of these explanations will “wash” with fair housing enforcers.  Now is the time for review of this information.  Supplementing resident files may bolster a defense of the “55+” status by proving the 80-20 ratio, but cannot substitute for consistent conformance to a policy of seeking POA documentation.  HUD’s requirements are crystal clear: “The housing facility or community must establish and maintain appropriate policies to require that occupants comply with the age verification procedures required by this section.”

Should you seek missing POA information?

Yes.  In a large scale review of resident files by fair housing enforcers, the main objective for review of proof of age may be to establish the 80-20 ratio: Proof of age in the file may itself be seen as evidence of adherence to collection of required data:  even after-acquired information reflects, at least, compliance with the 2-year survey requirement.  Proof of age includes  the following: driver’s license (an expired or out-of-state license seems ‘ok’), birth certificate, passport, immigration card, military identification, any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of “comparable reliability.”  This may include birth certificates, baptismal or marriage documents, perhaps, and other public records.

What if the tenant refuses to provide proof of age?

New purchaser:  Of course, refusal to supply proof of age when applying for tenancy is a basis for denying a tenancy application.  The regulations also allow for a declaration from a member of the household over 18 years of age, stating that at least one person in the homesite is at least 55 years of age.  This after-acquired information is permissible for the survey, but again does not bolster evidence of conformance to proof of age documentation required for tenancy approval.  

HUD provides a skeletal sample of certification.  This can also be used as part of the tenancy application alone or better yet as a backup to production of proof of age.  The sample reads as follows: “I, (name), am 18 years of age or older and a member of the household that resides at (housing facility or community), (unit number or designation).  I hereby certify that I have personal knowledge of the ages of the occupants of this household and that at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older.”  Actual proof of age should be obtained at the application stage to avoid false reporting – no defense to a failure to achieve the 80-20 ration.

The regs also allow for other proof of age if an existing resident refuses to provide it.  HUD states that “[I]f the occupants … refuse to comply with the age verification procedures, the [management] may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.  Such evidence may include: (1) Government records or documents, such as a local household census; (2) Prior forms or applications; or (3) A statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants.  The individual’s statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge and be signed under the penalty of perjury.”

Thus, the survey could be supplemented by including a sworn declaration or affidavit by any person with personal knowledge of the age of the resident’s age.  In past cases where proof of age was critically important, private investigation of public records to obtain that information has been conducted to provide such knowledge.  Remember however, that obtaining proof of age “after the fact” shows compliance with the 2-year survey requirement, but does not substitute for a consistent practice of securing the required information at the time of processing the tenancy application.

HUD gives the following example as acceptable: “the owner of a mobile home park where the residents own the coach but rent the land requires a statement of whether at least one occupant is 55 years of age or older before any sublease or new rental.”  In other words, the qualification procedure can be instituted within the application process itself.  HUD states such an example (“All new leases, new purchase agreements, or new applications contain a provision directly above the signatory line for leases, asserting that at least one occupant or the swelling will be 55 years of age or older.  In addition the community surveys all current residents for their occupancy status in compliance with the 55–or-older requirements”).  Actual proof of age should always be required with submission of the tenancy application as well.

Conclusion

The continuing survey requirement is mandatory.  Whether failure to comply will be fatal to the assertion of “older persons” status is unknown, but this survey requirement is part of the “intent” prong of operating an “older persons” community.  In sum, be sure that your records are accurate and up to date.

Let’s not forget that the requirements also mandate the re-survey.

What do the Regulations say? “…The procedures described in paragraph (b) [routinely determining the occupancy of each unit, including the identification of whether at least one occupant of each unit is 55 years of age or older] … must provide for regular updates, through surveys or other means, of the initial information supplied by the occupants of the housing facility or community. Such updates must take place once every two years ….”

The comments behind the regulations clarify the duties required of the housing provider. HUD received many objections to the regulations imposing a continuing duty of providing a “census” or re-verification of a park’s “older persons” (55+ years of age) status. HUD’s responses help us understand the duties of maintaining a qualified “older persons” community.

For example, there were objections to the re-survey mandate on the grounds it was too burdensome. HUD stated that owners would not be unduly burdened by the update requirements since the information “will be readily available in the files.”

This comment reflects that the survey requirement can be fulfilled by preparation of a summary of names and ages of the homeowners based on existing file information (assuming the files are up to date). One might annotate a rent roll with resident ages and satisfy the requirement. HUD emphasizes that “…the re-survey does not require that all supporting documents be collected again – only that the community confirm that those persons counted as occupying dwellings for purposes of meeting the 80% requirement are, in fact, still in occupancy.”

It is also clear that the survey is a “summary” and not required to include underlying documentation (remember the POA must be obtained for approval of tenancy and kept in the resident’s file): “[Only the overall survey summary is required to be available for review, not the supporting documentation. The word ‘summary’ has been added to this section”).

Compilation of the “Summary”

In review of the files to compile the required “summary,” it is possible that some files may be missing POA documentation. Missing POA reflects inconsistent conformance to a required age verification policy. This can be fatal to defending a “55+” status. Yet, there are plausible reasons why POA may be absent. Perhaps a resident’s tenancy commenced before the date of enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (September 12, 1988): this was the last date to “grandfather” underage residents excluded from the calculation of the 80-20 requirement; perhaps the Xerox copier did not work on the day identification was checked; perhaps the applicant’s age was so obvious that documentation was overlooked; perhaps the POA was misplaced. None of these explanations will “wash” with fair housing enforcers. Now is the time for review of this information. Supplementing resident files may bolster a defense of the “55+” status by proving the 80-20 ratio, but cannot substitute for consistent conformance to a policy of seeking POA documentation. HUD’s requirements are crystal clear: “The housing facility or community must establish and maintain appropriate policies to require that occupants comply with the age verification procedures required by this section.”

"472","472","3","Phil Querin Q&A Temporary Occupant Stealing Electrical Power","Question:  The owner of a manufactured home community discovers that a temporary occupant in his community is stealing electrical power.  PGE and the Portland Police have been out to the community and investigated the theft.  He is also growing marijuana in the home but has a medical marijuana card.  What notices does the landlord serve this household keeping in mind that he is the temporary occupant?  Who does the notice go to, the occupant or the resident or both?  The resident, who is the occupant’s mother, shows no inclination to deal with this problem.

Answer: Assuming that the landlord has a temporary occupancy agreement in place, the answers are found in ORS 90.275 (Temporary occupancy agreement; terms and conditions). Specifically:
•	The temporary occupancy agreement is between the landlord, tenant and temporary occupant – all must sign.
•	The temporary occupant does not have the same rights as a tenant under the landlord-tenant law.
•	One may terminate the temporary occupancy agreement as follows:
o	Only for cause that is a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement ; presumably the theft constitutes a material violation under your rules and regulations which the temporary occupant is required to comply with; it is certainly a violation of law, which would suffice.
o	The temporary occupant does not have a right to cure the violation;
o	Legally, you do not have to give written notice of termination to the temporary occupant.  However, in this case, I would do so, just for the record, and to make it clear that a notice of termination was, in fact, given.
o	The temporary occupant is required to “promptly vacate” upon receipt of the notice.  I suggest you give him/her a couple of days, just to avoid an issue.
o	Although the statute doesn’t expressly require it, I would copy the resident on the notice.  

•	If, after you give the notice, the temporary occupant sneaks back in the evenings, as seems to occur frequently, you should give the temporary occupant a formal “No Trespassing” letter, with a copy to the resident.  It would be preferable if you had these notices personally delivered if you can.  Then if the temporary occupant comes back, you may call the police to have him/her removed.

•	Alternatively, except as provided in ORS 90.449 (the statute protecting victims of domestic violence), a landlord may terminate the tenancy of the resident under ORS 90.630 (the statute permitting for-cause terminations) if the temporary occupant fails to promptly vacate the dwelling, or if the resident materially violates the temporary occupancy agreement.
•	A temporary occupant shall be treated as a squatter if he/she continues to occupy the dwelling unit after you have terminated the temporary occupancy agreement.
o	ORS 90.100 (41) defines a squatter as “a person occupying a dwelling unit who is not so entitled under a rental agreement or who is not authorized by the tenant to occupy that dwelling unit.” 
o	The landlord-tenant statutes do not have a specific provision dealing with eviction of “squatters.” Although it implies you could have them forcefully removed, I would not attempt any self-help remedies.  Rather, you could simply file an eviction, attach a copy of the termination notice, and proceed from there. Alternatively, you could proceed against the temporary occupant and the mother, if she did nothing to make sure he was out. If all else fails, I prefer the former approach, since frequently, a parent - especially an aged parent – is simply not capable of insisting that the son/daughter leave, and I don’t believe that failure alone, should result in them losing their right to remain in the community.

•	Before entering into a temporary occupancy agreement, the law permits landlords to screen the proposed temporary occupant for issues regarding conduct or for a criminal record.  If that was not done in this instance it should have been. (Note that a landlord may not screen the proposed temporary occupant for credit history or income level.)

Lastly, I see no significance in the temporary occupant having a marijuana card. It isn’t a license to steal.

"473","473","3","RV Park Question and Answer with Attorney Mark Busch - Background Checks in RV Parks","By Mark L. Busch, P.C., Attorney at Law

Question: A mobile home park has a number of spaces reserved for RVs.  Many of the RV tenants are seasonal workers and usually rent a space for 3-6 months before moving on.  Is it necessary to do background checks for such short-term tenants?  How should the rental agreement be structured?  Month to month, weekly, or fixed term?

Answer:  Even though some of your RV tenants are short-termers, I always recommend a complete tenant background check no matter how long the anticipated tenancy.  As a businessperson, you have an obligation to yourself to ensure that every RV tenant checks out  with a background screening for criminal, credit and eviction history.  As a landlord, you have an obligation by law to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by not allowing “bad seeds” into the park. 

Most problems can be avoided by doing your due diligence at the beginning of the tenancy with a proper background screening.  The fact that these particular tenants are more transient than usual doesn’t matter.  

In some cases, it is even more important to check on transient tenants.  By way of example, one mobile home park client allowed a woman with an RV into the park without any background check.  The woman ended up being a “professional tenant” who worked the system and dragged out  the eviction process for several months.  She later popped up at another mobile home client’s park and pulled the same scam.

As for the structure of the rental agreement for transient tenants, the first thing to do is use MHCO Form 80 (Recreational Vehicle Space Rental Agreement).  I typically recommend a simple month to month agreement so that you can evict on 30 days’ written notice if things don’t work out with a particular RV tenant.  Weekly tenancies are also allowable, although most RV tenants want assurances of a longer tenancy.  Finally, a short fixed term tenancy (i.e., 3 months) is also acceptable so long as you’re comfortable with the tenant and have done the required background checks.

"474","474","3","A Refresher on the Housing for Older Persons Act (55 and Older Communities)","By: Robert S. Coldren, ESQ and James S. Morse, Esq.

If you are reading this, chances are you are one of the millions of baby boomers at or near retirement. Although you might not care for the moniker, the government has officially designated you as an “older person”. If you own property designated as housing for “seniors” you should periodically refresh yourself on the state of the law protecting “older persons” and to avoid the mistakes of other property owners.

History

The Civil Rights Act of 1968 enacted The Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) to prohibit housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The FHA was amended in 1988 to expand its coverage to prohibit discrimination based on disability or family status, meaning the presence of a child under the age of 18 and pregnant women. Because the creation of families as a protected class clashed with the operation of retirement or adult communities, the 1988 amendments included exemptions for housing developments that qualified as housing for persons over the age of 55. Because there was an inherent conflict between protected family status and the exemption for older persons, Congress responded with The Housing For Older Persons Act of 1995 (“HOPA”) which fine tuned the exemptions and is now the definitive authority for owners of such housing. (You should also be aware that municipalities can have ordinances prohibiting discrimination for categories broader than the Civil Rights Act. Examples of common ordinances gaining popularity are discrimination in housing on the basis of HIV/AIDS status, sexual orientation. Such ordinances are not addressed in this article.)

Occupancy Requirement to Qualify for Exemption

HOPA maintained the requirement that at least 80% of exempt housing must have one occupant who is 55 years of age or older. It also still required that the exempt hosing publish and follow policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent to be housing for persons 55 and older. Significant in terms of capital costs, HOPA eliminated the requirement that 55 and older hosing had to maintain “significant facilities and services” designed for the elderly. (Communities that are occupied solely by persons who are 62 and older are also exempt from the prohibition against family discrimination under Section 100.303.)

“Wiggle Room” Factor

At first blush, the 80% requirement appears to give a property owner some “wiggle room” to comply with the exemption. HOPA specifically allows a 55 and older community to be “exempt” from the preference for families if, after September 13, 1988, 80% of the units are occupied by at least one person age 55 years or older. Units occupied by employees of the housing facility or community who are under the age 55 do not count against the 80% as long as the employees perform substantial duties related to the management or maintenance of the community. Likewise, units occupied by persons who are disabled and require a reasonable accommodation, also do not count against the 80%.

However, the 80% requirement can also be a property owners’ pitfall if it is achieved improperly. The 80% requirement does not mean that the property owner can manipulate the remaining 20% of units occupied by persons under the age of 55. The 80% occupancy requirement is coupled with an additional requirement that the facility or community adheres to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent to be a 55 or older facility. A manager cannot merely choose to rent to “good” non-seniors or families just because the facility is over 80% senior.

One provision of HOPA which, on the surface, appears troublesome is Section 100.305(h) which provides that each housing facility may determine the age restriction for units that are not occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. On its face, this provision appears to allow a community to set any age requirement it wishes for the twenty percent (20%) of spaces which are not required to be occupied by a person 55 years of age or older, including requiring the occupants of the remaining twenty percent (20%) of spaces to be adults. However, this would appear to be contrary to the general intent of the FHA to prohibit discrimination on the basis of “family status”. A more likely interpretation is that the housing provider need not apply any age restriction on occupancy of the remaining twenty percent (20%) of rental units. This interpretation seems likely, not only in view of the general intent of the FHA, but in view of Section 100.306(d) which provides that a housing facility or community may allow occupancy by families with children as long as it meets the intent requirements of Sections 100.305 and 100.306(a).

An argument could well be made that a community must allow up to twenty percent (20%) of the spaces to be occupied by persons who do not otherwise satisfy the community’s minimum age requirements. The problem is that a park which “uses up” its twenty percent (20%) allotment may find itself below the 80% requirement if a space which was previously occupied by a person 55 years of age or older ceases to be so occupied. This could occur as a result of an older tenant dying or moving out of the community.

It has been our experience that HUD has, from time to time, interpreted the “twenty percent” allowance as a “fudge factor” in order to avoid hardship where, for example, an older tenant dies, leaving a widow who does not satisfy the community’s minimum age requirements. This interpretation was bolstered by the requirement that the housing be intended for persons 55 years of age or older and that the properties have rules that limit residency to persons meeting the age requirements. Deliberately allowing persons under the age of 55 to move into the community seems contrary to this intention.

**Tip: In many states the law requires that mobile home parks owners uniformly enforce all published rules. To allow some households to avoid the requirement could run afoul of such laws leaving the door open for a disgruntled tenant to sue on a claim that the management is not uniformly enforcing its own rules.

Published Procedures & Policies of Intent

In addition to requiring that at least 80% of the occupied units be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older, HOPA requires that the housing be “intended and operated” for person 55 years of age or older, and that the housing facility “publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate its intent” to qualify for the 55 or older exemption. Section 100.306(a) sets forth a non-exclusive list or relevant factors in determining whether the park “demonstrates” this “intent”:

(1) The manner in which the housing facility is described to prospective residents;
(2) And advertising designed to attract prospective residents;
(3) Lease provisions;
(4) Written rules and regulations;
(5) The maintenance and consistent application or relevant procedures;
(6) Actual practices; and
(7) Public posting in common areas of statements describing the facility as housing for persons 55 years of age or older;

These requirements bolster the “common sense” approach to a community demonstrating its intent to be housing for older persons. Specifically, without limitation, the parks’ residency documents need to clearly state the age restrictions on residency, and the age restrictions need to be consistently enforced.

Unscrupulous attempts by property owners to manipulate the intent to remain senior housing have resulted in adverse judgments. In a 2003 federal case in California, Housing Rights Center et al. v. Galaxy Apartments, et al., the apartment complex and management company was sued for allegedly telling an expectant mother that it would not accept families with children because it was a “seniors only” complex. The Housing Rights Center sent “testers” to the building and learned that childless adult testers of all ages were accepted and only testers with children or who were expecting children were told that the complex was seniors only. Obviously, the apartment owner was not complying with the “intent” of the over 55 exemption and was ordered to pay the plaintiffs $51,000 and enter into a two year fair housing training program.

Some states require that housing intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older register with state agencies. You should consult your legal counsel for the applicable registration and renewal process in your state.

Age Verification

HOPA provides specific guidelines for “age verification”. To protect your property, these procedures should be followed to the point that, at any given time in the past, you should be able to demonstrate, the percentage of units that were occupied by at least one person age 55 or older.

Section 100.307(d) provides that the following documents are considered “reliable” documentation of the age of the occupants:

(1) Driver’s license;
(2) Birth Certificate;
(3) Passport;
(4) Immigration card;
(5) Military identification;
(6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability, or
(7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.

This last provision is useful in those cases where tenants who are believed to be over 55 years of age fail or refuse to provide proof of age to the park by allowing any other adult member of the household to sign a statement to the effect that the person in question is, in fact, at least 55 years of age.

**Tip: Make it a policy to obtain a written application for tenancy from every household and keep those applications for the length of the tenancy.

Section 100.307(g) further provides that: “If the occupants of a particular dwelling unit fail to comply with the age verification procedures, the housing facility or community may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.” This section goes on to provide that such evidence may include government records or documents, such as a census; prior forms or applications; or a statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants. In the latter case, the individual’s statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge. Compliance with this provision most probably would be met by a park employee statement as to their opinion of the age of a tenant, based upon the tenant’s appearance and, if applicable, the apparent age of the tenant’s adult children.

A typical pitfall for owners of such properties is the HOPA requirement that the age verification information must be updated at least every two years, pursuant to Section 100.307(c).

**Tip: In addition to keeping the tenant’s application, the management should consider developing a form which it distributes to all spaces at least once every two years, asking residents to confirm the names and ages of all persons who are currently residing in the home. This is probably good policy in any case, since a record of what adults are actually occupying a home is useful in other situations (e.g., naming all adults occupants in an unlawful detainer complaint.)

However, this would appear to be contrary to the general intent of the FHA to prohibit discrimination on the basis of “family status”. A more likely interpretation is that the housing provider need not apply any age restriction on occupancy of the remaining twenty percent (20%) of rental units. This interpretation seems likely, not only in view of the general intent of the FHA, but in view of Section 100.306(d) which provides that a housing facility or community may allow occupancy by families with children as long as it meets the intent requirements of Sections 100.305 and 100.306(a).

An argument could well be made that a community must allow up to twenty percent (20%) of the spaces to be occupied by persons who do not otherwise satisfy the community’s minimum age requirements. The problem is that a park which “uses up” its twenty percent (20%) allotment may find itself below the 80% requirement if a space which was previously occupied by a person 55 years of age or older ceases to be so occupied. This could occur as a result of an older tenant dying or moving out of the community.

It has been our experience that HUD has, from time to time, interpreted the “twenty percent” allowance as a “fudge factor” in order to avoid hardship where, for example, an older tenant dies, leaving a widow who does not satisfy the community’s minimum age requirements. This interpretation was bolstered by the requirement that the housing be intended for persons 55 years of age or older and that the properties have rules that limit residency to persons meeting the age requirements. Deliberately allowing persons under the age of 55 to move into the community seems contrary to this intention.

**Tip: In many states the law requires that mobile home parks owners uniformly enforce all published rules. To allow some households to avoid the requirement could run afoul of such laws leaving the door open for a disgruntled tenant to sue on a claim that the management is not uniformly enforcing its own rules.

Published Procedures & Policies of Intent

In addition to requiring that at least 80% of the occupied units be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older, HOPA requires that the housing be “intended and operated” for person 55 years of age or older, and that the housing facility “publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate its intent” to qualify for the 55 or older exemption. Section 100.306(a) sets forth a non-exclusive list or relevant factors in determining whether the park “demonstrates” this “intent”:

(1) The manner in which the housing facility is described to prospective residents;
(2) And advertising designed to attract prospective residents;
(3) Lease provisions;
(4) Written rules and regulations;
(5) The maintenance and consistent application or relevant procedures;
(6) Actual practices; and
(7) Public posting in common areas of statements describing the facility as housing for persons 55 years of age or older;

These requirements bolster the “common sense” approach to a community demonstrating its intent to be housing for older persons. Specifically, without limitation, the parks’ residency documents need to clearly state the age restrictions on residency, and the age restrictions need to be consistently enforced.

Unscrupulous attempts by property owners to manipulate the intent to remain senior housing have resulted in adverse judgments. In a 2003 federal case in California, Housing Rights Center et al. v. Galaxy Apartments, et al., the apartment complex and management company was sued for allegedly telling an expectant mother that it would not accept families with children because it was a “seniors only” complex. The Housing Rights Center sent “testers” to the building and learned that childless adult testers of all ages were accepted and only testers with children or who were expecting children were told that the complex was seniors only. Obviously, the apartment owner was not complying with the “intent” of the over 55 exemption and was ordered to pay the plaintiffs $51,000 and enter into a two year fair housing training program.

Some states require that housing intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older register with state agencies. You should consult your legal counsel for the applicable registration and renewal process in your state.

Age Verification

HOPA provides specific guidelines for “age verification”. To protect your property, these procedures should be followed to the point that, at any given time in the past, you should be able to demonstrate, the percentage of units that were occupied by at least one person age 55 or older.

Section 100.307(d) provides that the following documents are considered “reliable” documentation of the age of the occupants:

(1) Driver’s license;
(2) Birth Certificate;
(3) Passport;
(4) Immigration card;
(5) Military identification;
(6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability, or
(7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.

This last provision is useful in those cases where tenants who are believed to be over 55 years of age fail or refuse to provide proof of age to the park by allowing any other adult member of the household to sign a statement to the effect that the person in question is, in fact, at least 55 years of age.

**Tip: Make it a policy to obtain a written application for tenancy from every household and keep those applications for the length of the tenancy.

Section 100.307(g) further provides that: “If the occupants of a particular dwelling unit fail to comply with the age verification procedures, the housing facility or community may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.” This section goes on to provide that such evidence may include government records or documents, such as a census; prior forms or applications; or a statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants. In the latter case, the individual’s statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge. Compliance with this provision most probably would be met by a park employee statement as to their opinion of the age of a tenant, based upon the tenant’s appearance and, if applicable, the apparent age of the tenant’s adult children.

A typical pitfall for owners of such properties is the HOPA requirement that the age verification information must be updated at least every two years, pursuant to Section 100.307(c).

**Tip: In addition to keeping the tenant’s application, the management should consider developing a form which it distributes to all spaces at least once every two years, asking residents to confirm the names and ages of all persons who are currently residing in the home. This is probably good policy in any case, since a record of what adults are actually occupying a home is useful in other situations (e.g., naming all adults occupants in an unlawful detainer complaint.)

"476","476","3","Phil Querin Q&A Billing Back Sewer Charges to Residents","Question:  Our park does not have individual meters and at this point both the water and sewer on included in the monthly rent charge. Is there a method for billing back the sewer charges (no water) to the residents?  

Answer: Sewer changes are considered a utility. ORS 90.532 (“Billing methods for utility or service charges”) provides that, subject to certain exceptions, landlords may provide for utilities or services to tenants by one or more of several alternative billing methods, depending upon the billing “relationship” between landlord and tenant:

1.	A relationship between the tenant and the utility or service provider in which the utility provider provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space, including any utility or service line, and bills the tenant directly; and the landlord does not act as a provider.
2.	A relationship between the landlord, tenant and utility or service provider in which the utility provider provides the utility or service to the landlord; the landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space (or to a common area); and (a) the landlord: includes the cost of the utility or service in the tenant’s rent; or (b) bills the tenant for the utility or service charge separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter.
3.	And lastly, a relationship between the landlord, tenant and utility or service provider in which the utility provider provides the utility or service to the landlord, the landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space; and the landlord uses a submeter to measure the utility or service actually provided to the space and bills the tenant for a utility or service charge for the amount provided.

It appears that No. 2(a) above may currently apply to your situation. In order to “charge back” the residents, I assume you mean charge them directly (outside the base rent) for the cost of the sewer service. Thus, what I understand you to be asking, is whether you can “convert” from 2(a) to 2(b).  If your current sewer service is measured by water consumption, and your intent is to separately charge residents a pro rata basis calculated by a master water meter, then ORS 90.532(2(c) applies, which provides that a landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for sewer service, if sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.

By your question, it appears that sewer and water are both included in base rent, at present.  Thus, the prorata method (i.e. direct billing for sewer charges outside of base rent) would only be allowed if you already had it in place for all residents prior to January 1, 2010.  

Unfortunately, it appears that unless you begin submetering your water, you will be unable to separately charge for sewer on a prorata basis outside of your base rent.

MHCO Legal Counsel


Understanding the requirements for the sale of homes inside a manufactured housing community is important for residents and landlords, alike.  If the procedures are followed by both sides, the transfer of ownership can be smooth.  However, if either side fails to abide by the law, the rental agreement or the community's rules, problems can occur.  Here are some general guidelines to follow when a resident wants to sell their home and have the new buyer approved for occupancy in the community :

•	A landlord may not prohibit the resident from selling their home to a qualified buyer who wants to apply to remain in the community.   Conversely, the landlord may not require a resident to remove the home from the space solely because they have placed it up for sale.

•	A landlord may not charge a commission or fee for the sale of the home.  The only exception is if the landlord is acting as an agent for the seller pursuant to written contract.

•	The landlord may not prohibit the placement of ""for sale"" signs on or in the resident's home. However, the size, placement and character of signs are subject to reasonable rules of the landlord.

Tenant Duties/Obligations

•	The resident must give not more than 10 days' written notice prior to the sale of the home.

•	Prior to the sale, the prospective purchaser must submit a complete and accurate written application for occupancy; they may not occupy the home until after they have been approved by the landlord.  

•	The resident must give notice to any lienholder, prospective purchaser or person licensed to sell manufactured homes, of the location of all properly functioning smoke alarms and any other community rules and regulations.

•	That the prospective purchaser pay in full all rents, fees, deposits or charges owed by the resident prior to the landlord's acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a new resident. However, this  requirement  does not  apply  if  the  sale  is  by  the  home's lienholder. The landlord may also require that the resident give this information to any lienholder, prospective purchaser or person licensed to sell manufactured homes.


Landlord Duties/Obligations

•	At the time the landlord gives the prospective purchaser an application for occupancy, the landlord shall also provide copies of  the  statement  of  policy (“SOP”), the rental agreement  and the rules and regulations, as well  as any  conditions imposed  on  a subsequent  resale of the home.  Note: The terms of the SOP, rental agreement and rules and regulations do not need to be the same as those applicable to the selling resident's documents.

•	The landlord must accept or reject the application within 7 days following the day the landlord receives a complete and accurate written application. 

o	Note: If the resident has not previously given the landlord the required 10 days' notice before putting the home up for sale pursuant to ORS 90.680(4)(a), the 7-day period to accept or reject is extended to 10 days.
o	Note: The landlord and prospective purchaser may agree to a longer time for the landlord to evaluate the application information or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord’s screening criteria.  [Caution: Such an extension of time should always be in writing and signed by the prospective applicant.]

•	Note: An  application  is  not  complete  until  the  prospective  purchaser  pays  the  required applicant screening charge and provides the landlord with all information and documentation, including any financial data and references, required in by the landlord. 

•	A landlord may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant. Reasonable cause for rejection includes, but is not limited to, failure of the prospective purchaser to meet the landlords conditions for approval as provided in ORS 90.510 (Statement of policy) (5)(h) or failure of the prospective purchasers references to respond to the landlord’s timely request for verification within the time allowed for acceptance or rejection. 

•	The  landlord  must  furnish  the  seller and  prospective purchaser  with  a  written statement of the  reasons for the rejection.   However, if the rejection is based on a consumer report, the landlord may not disclose the contents of the report to anyone other than the purchaser. The landlord shall disclose to the seller in writing  that the rejection  is  based upon information  contained in  a  consumer  report  and  that  the landlord may not disclose the information contained in that report.

•	If the landlord does not require a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy in the community, or if the landlord does not accept or reject the prospective purchaser within the time required:	
o 	The landlord waives the right to bring an action against the existing resident for breach
of the rental agreement's resale requirements.
o 	Upon completion of the sale, the prospective purchaser may occupy the home as a legal resident under the same conditions [i.e. SOP, rental agreement and rules] imposed upon the existing resident who sold the home.
o 		Unless the new resident otherwise agrees in writing, the landlord may not impose any new conditions on the tenancy beyond those contained in the selling resident's rental agreement.

•	A landlord may not, because of the age, size, style or original construction material of the home [or because the home was built prior to adoption of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 5403], in compliance with the standards of that Act in effect at that time or in compliance with the state building code as defined in ORS 455.010 (Definitions for ORS chapter 455)]:
o	Reject an application for tenancy; or
o	Require a prospective purchaser of an existing home to remove it from the rented space.

•	Note:  If a resident who has received a 30-day notice for repair or deterioration under ORS 90.632 attempts to sell their home without making the corrections contained in the notice, they must provide a copy of the notice to that buyer prior to the closing of the sale. Alternatively, the landlord may provide the buyer with a copy of the notice. The landlord may require, as a condition of approval, that the purchaser comply with the notice within the time set forth in the notice. If the tenancy has been terminated under the notice, the prospective purchaser does not have a right to leave the home in the park.
 

•	If the home is the subject of an active abandonment initiated by the landlord under ORS 90.675, the resident has the right to sell it to a park-approved purchaser under substantially the same conditions as would be imposed on a lienholder in such circumstances.1

"479","479","3","Fair Housing: Occupancy By Who's Standard (Part 2 of 2)","By Jo Becker, Education/Outreach Specialist, Fair Housing Council 
Serving Oregon and SW Washington

In our last article, we looked at the work of Tim Iglesias and the legal implications of, as well as the disparate impact of overly restrictive occupancy standards, including two-people-per-bedroom policies.  

In this article, the last in the two-part series, the work of Ellen Pader, an anthropologist and Associate Director of the Housing Research Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst we look at the historical and cultural perspectives behind our country’s occupancy policies.  

I recently read Ms. Pader’s Housing Occupancy Standards:  Inscribing Ethnicity and Family Relations on the Land, published in the Journal of Architectural and Planning Research in the winter of 2002.  Despite being more than a few years old, it is packed with – what for me – was stunning revelations about the deep and particularly contrived history of occupancy standards in the US.  As you read along with me, I ask that you do so with an open mind.  Step outside the lens of your role as a housing provider to gain greater perspective.  Warning:  Ms. Pader’s vocabulary is rich but dense; I hope the excerpts I have selected here are not too arduous.  That said, I strongly suggest you download the entire document (available at www.FHCO.org/occupancy.htm) and read it over a cup of something yummy some long, rainy evening.  I’ll start you off with the verbose preface to Pader’s paper:

THE PREMISE

“Attempts to define family and the appropriate sociospatial arrangements for an idealized “normal” U.S. household formation have had profound influences on the design and size of houses, apartments, and communities throughout the twentieth century.  Based on ethnographic, historical, social, political, and legal research, this paper explores the sociopolitical construction of occupancy standards…  It concludes that the regulations drive from a combination of upper-class English ideals and outdated scientific knowledge, with concomitant moralistic and assimilationist aspirations on the part of the policy makers.  Today, these social ideals still implicitly underlie much of our current urban design, affecting the ethnic, racial, and economic structure of cities, and by extension, homelessness, coercive segregation, and access to services.”

THE CONFLICT

“The conflict at the base of this article is how we define and conceptualize housing discrimination on the basis of national origin and by extension… familial status…  This inevitably leads to an exploration of how mundane daily practice and macrolevel social policies are inextricably entwined with one another.  The daily practice in question here is sleeping arrangements… This directly influences where households with restricted means and more than four or five household members can live.

I am retheorizing the definition of ""national origin"" away from its legal definition of the place of origin of one's self or one's ancestors – and toward an anthropological definition of what it means to be from… a particular geographic locale. This means reframing the standard question derived from the 1949 Housing Act which set the goal that all citizens should enjoy ""a decent home and suitable living environment."" Thus, rather than asking ""Do all households, regardless of national origin or familial status, have equal access to decent housing?,"" I ask ""Do all households, regardless of national origin or familial status, have the same opportunity to decide for themselves what they consider acceptable and preferred living arrangements, and, therefore, have equal access to decent housing?"" 

…The basic questions are:  What is the basis and justification for current standards – which are generally some variation of no more than two people per bedroom?  How did this ratio become normalized and win over three people per bedroom, for instance; and why did bedrooms come into the talk of restricting occupancy anyway?  Even culturally mediated definitions of what should be counted as a bedroom have found their way into codes and legislation.  How did occupancy standards come to be such a bone of contention?

…This is not a call to remove occupancy standards altogether and return to the severely densely populated and ill-kempt tenements of early 1900s New York City; this is a call for a reappraisal of currently accepted standards. 

…Debates around regulating occupancy standards place us firmly in the blurry jurisdictional boundaries between courts and Congress.  Here, I will walk in that blur as I draw on some of the social, cultural, historical, political, and legal data that make up my argument as to why most current occupancy standards should be deemed illegal…

…Current occupancy standards and their rationales are historical and cultural artifacts that have been accorded the status of universal truth.  …The basic strands of my argument… are:

First: The general justification for current standards presume [they are] reasonable to the
ordinary person.  If I can demonstrate that they explicitly derive from, and refer to, upper-class,
English and Anglo-American definitions of reasonable, and that definition is in fact unreasonable to
many of the ethnicities in the U.S. exactly on account of where they or their ancestors are from and
what it means to be from there, then surely the prevailing definitions of ""ordinary"" and ""reasonable""
categories lose their privileged positions.

Second: The standards tend to be further justified under the rubric of providing for the health, safety, comfort, and convenience of the inhabitants. I argue that it is not [what] is being protected by the 2:I standard as purported. Rather it is a very specific, culturally constricted definition of moral health, safety, comfort and convenience. This is not to argue that less restrictive occupancy standards would similarly have no legitimate physical health, safety, and comfort rationale.

What is crowded to some is exactly what is comfortable to others; what is comfortable to some is
exactly what is lonely to others. Such differing reactions to spatial relations are largely the consequence of socialization and cultural practices, with implications beyond occupancy standards (Werner , et al., 1997).

[It should be noted that it] …is not just people who cannot afford more who share bedrooms.  In countries as different as Mexico and China people commonly choose to share bedrooms while leaving other bedrooms unused.  In a demographic study of household density in the U.S. using 1990 census data, researchers found that Latino and Asian households often have more than two people per bedroom even when their income is the same as White and Black households of the same size, again suggesting choice is at play, not economic necessity (Myers, et.al, 1996). 

…Sharing household space with extended family members is a common way of living throughout much of the world, and a common way of getting through hard times, or even strange times such as first entering a new country.  I have often been told when I have interviewed people from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, a home full of kin is not considered crowded as long as there is room on the floor.

…[And], what might have been justifiable on health grounds early in the twentieth century… has become antiquated due to modern medicine and technology.  …I often wonder what current policy-makers would say if they knew that their health and safety rationale was based on nineteenth century concepts about miasmas and vitiated, or impure air.  This cutting edge scientific knowledge of the late nineteenth century proved, without doubt, that one's own breath was full of deadly carbonic poisons and that some 40% of deaths in New York City were directly caused by breathing one's own self-inflicted noxious air –  you could drown in your own exhaled breath (Townsend, 1989; lanes, 1876).  This led to the perceived need to ensure the right combination of ventilation for dispelling the poisons to match the number of people in an enclosed space.

THE HISTORY

…[W]hile the occupancy standards might be facially neutral, that is they are equally applied to everyone across the board, their effect certainly is not, and their intent often is not either.

…In large part, occupancy standards derive from the tenement conditions of 19th / early 20th century New York, the Lower East Side in particular with its densely populated immigrant households.  As Social Darwinism was losing clout, other ways of denigrating the humanity of the largely Jewish, Polish, Italian, and Slavic populations were taking its place. It must be remembered that each of these non-WASP ethnic groups was considered a separate race; they were what historian David Roediger (1991) calls the 'not-yet-white,"" a concept with significant implications here.

Turn of the century urban tenements were pretty miserable.  No one was responsible for cleaning the
streets, buildings tended to be dirty, dark, poorly maintained, and often unsanitary (DeForest and
Veiller, 1903; lanes, 1876; Lubove, 1962; Veiller, 1910).  

…Like public and low-income housing today, there is a conflation of the now decrepit physical environment left to deteriorate by the government or private landlords with the moral character of the inhabitants.  …I wonder, should it be the character of the people who leave the housing to deteriorate, not the residents who have to live in that decrepitude, that is conflated with the condition of the property?

[For h]ousing reformers – who came from the middle- and upper-class establishment – …[t]he dominant belief of the era was that bad housing conditions, including too many people per unit according to their standards of uncomfortable crowding, directly produced illness, crime, intemperance, promiscuity, and the breakdown of the family.  Their goal was to bring order to what they considered to be disordered, and thereby dangerous.  The reapportionment of domestic space was one step in the orderly Americanization of these not-yet-white immigrants.

A 1905 survey [found] about 50% of the apartments housed three or four people per room, while 25% had five or more people (Takaki, 1993). The fairly new discipline of Public Health fought for the first building codes in New York State in 1867 through their organization, the American Public Health Association (APHA).  They wanted to contain the spread of contagious disease, both within the slums and from moving uptown.  Improving physical health was only one part of their mission; improving what they assumed to be a lapse in moral health was more important for justifying the push toward assimilation through restructuring domestic space, and in particular, sleeping arrangements.

…[W]hat constituted overuse of sleeping rooms to the Reformers (and most rooms were sleeping rooms in the tenements) was lack of physical privacy.  The ability to gain privacy by having one's own physically bounded space to sleep and think, was by now perceived as an essential necessity for healthful living. Too many people sharing, children sharing bedrooms with their parents, and of course, sharing with lodgers, 
almost inevitably means that there can be no provision for privacy or decency, and results in
sexual precocity and in many cases promiscuity, which may, of course, in time lead to a
criminal record. (Gries and Ford, 1932:xx)

This clearly articulated environmental deterministic view from the 1932 reports of President Hoover's Commission on Housing and Home Ownership is no different than the earlier views of [other] reformers.  Ironically, these moralists did not consider that many people in a room was a form of surveillance which might even mitigate sexual abuse.  If any sleeping arrangement is to be suspect… it should be private sleeping rooms with their closeable and lockable doors.

THE STANDARD

…The first occupancy standard in the U.S. was enacted in 1870 [in] San Francisco [and] required a minimum of 500 cubic feet of air space per person.  However. it was disproportionately enforced in Chinatown where low-paid, single, working Chinese men had no choice but to share rooms with less air space each than mandated.  In 1876 California made this minimum a state-wide law. 

…In 1879 New York City passed its first occupancy standard.  It required 600 cubic feet of air space per person.  This derived in part from the scientifically ""objective"" belief in miasmas and vitiated air, that one's own breath contained poisonous carbonic acids.  It was believed that without a minimal amount of space and renewable air, people could literally drown in their own breath (Townsend, 1989; lanes, 1876).  By 1901 this was decreased to 400 cubic feet for each adult and 200 for each child, still with an underlying, scientific health justification.

These early… laws provide an important caution:  Where does the line between caring for the plight of others and discrimination lie?  It is not always a clearly defined or overt line.  When does the desire to improve material conditions of the disenfranchised run a collision course with ethnocentrically derived moral platitudes?

…The reformers of the Progressive movement were largely responsible for getting occupancy standards enacted in order to improve the slum conditions and did at least replace the prevailing genetic interpretation of why certain groups predominated in many northern urban slums, with an environmental determinist interpretation, which is a step up.  

…Progressive concerns with the design and use of low-income immigrant housing were not simply
altruistic.  …Overcrowded and unsanitary apartments in urban neighborhoods also made 'productive' living very difficult (1988:82).  …housing was seen as an important political tool, to enhance both assimilation and worker productivity.

The emphasis on physically bounded privacy as a moral and even political good was part of the turn
of the last century public discourse.  Thus, in a 1905 speech, United States Commissioner of Labor,
Charles P. Neill pronounced that: 

[H]ome, above all things, means privacy. It means the possibility of keeping your family off from other families.  There must be a separate house, and as far as possible separate rooms, so that at an early period of life the idea of rights to property, the right to things, to privacy may be instilled.  (Wright, 1981:126)

…In the 1939 publication, Principles for Healthful Housing, the [American Public Health Association] wrote:
'A room of one's own' is the ideal in this respect; but we can at least insist on a room shared
with not more than one other person as an essential minimum.  Such a room should be occupied only by persons of the same sex except for married couples and young children. The age at which separation of sexes should occur is fixed by law in England at 10 years, but some American authorities would place the figure 2 years lower.  Sleeping-rooms of children above the age of 2 years, according to psychiatric opinion, should be separate from those of parents.  (p. 16)

…The British Act was explicitly a basis for the American Public Health Association's (APHA) reports
entitled Standards for Healthful Housing.  [These] then became the basis for the standards adopted by HUD and non-governmental standards creating agencies since the 1950s.

…In 1950 the APHA published:  “privacy in the home should be one of the fundamental objectives of
design… (p. 15-16).”  They also published a confession of sorts:  The minimum occupancy standards necessary to attain the goal of ""healthful housing ...closely approximates actual practice in the high- income groups"" (1950: xx, italics added), making explicit that one sector of society, the high-income primarily white northern European Protestant, had become the marker for all.

…the home design guidelines found in HUD's handbooks and most housing codes reiterate and help maintain certain culturally acceptable notions of proper personal and social behavior.  The same culturally imbued structural principles about privacy, privatization and proper moral behavior underlying the 2:1 codes guide the standard definition of a bedroom:  ""a bedroom cannot be a passthrough to another room"" (HUD, 1985:6-5).

…Conflated with this are questions of whether ""a room used for sleeping"" has to be a room labeled as a bedroom, and whether any non-passthrough which is not for instance, a bathroom or kitchen, can be counted as a bedroom for the purposes of establishing maximum occupancy.  The ambiguity here is at the basis of much legal and political action.

[An unpublished 1940 paper for the APHA explicitly states], “The health justification is to prevent interruption of sleep, but the moral argument is more commonly used” (APHA Archives). 

…These statements explicitly and intentionally privilege one culturally specific lifeway, discriminating
in the creation of the standards against people with different preferred modes of living, and against
Iow-income families with children.

…These seemingly neutral and healthy sociospatial relations found their way into the child raising dictates of a person who highly influenced how many of us were raised, Dr. Spock the baby doctor. 
Starting in the late 1940s, and continuing into later editions of Baby and Child Care, he wrote that
children should ideally have a room of their own ""where they can keep their own possessions under
control and have privacy when they want it."" (1976:201)

In the 1980s, another great arbiter of American culture, Dear Abby, wrote in What Every Teen Should Know:  Youngsters ""need a room to retreat to"" in order to help them grow as individuals…  (Van Buren: n.d.).

…[The moral argument] is based on the U.S. emphasis on individualism objectified in the continual reiteration of the necessity of physical privacy within the home to attain a particular concept of physical, psychological, and social health.  As I have suggested, in societies which value and practice interdependency, in which individualism and physical privacy are a punishment, a form of alienation, not a goal to be desired, one commonly finds house plans and social and spatial relations which correlate with and reinforce the concept of interdependency rather than independency (Pader, 1993).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Various municipalities and policy-makers are trying to change the local occupancy codes to limit the number of people who may live in a unit…  Not surprisingly, it is whoever are the current unwanted populations, the not-yet-white populations, that these codes are being used against.

For instance, in 1992, Brisefio v. the City of Santa Ana, the lawyer for Mr. Brisefio claimed the city
had racist intentions and was trying to rid the city of the growing number of people of Mexican origin (Brisefio v. City of Santa Ana, CA, 6Cal. App. 4th 1378 1992).  The judge feared that the impact of
the proposed ordinance would be greater homelessness and could find no compelling reason to permit the city to have a more restrictive policy than the state.  Other municipalities have passed restrictive occupancy policies and then lost them in court.

IN SUMMARY

…My point then is not to suggest that people from some ethnic groups prefer to be packed like herrings in a barrel.  Rather, it is to set a stage for less ethnocentric, more culturally inclusive occupancy standards.  Of course most people would like to be in a position to choose whatever size home they want, and then choose for themselves how to apportion the space – maybe by giving each person their own physically bound private space, or maybe by sharing all spaces with immediate and extended family, or maybe some other configuration altogether.  

In conclusion, I argue that what we are talking about here is not physical and psychological health and safety as the codes are supposed to protect, but moral health and safety from the perspective of early 20th century upper-class and mostly northern European reformers, transposed and naturalized into the late 20th /  early 21st century policies, and priorities about individualism, privacy, personal property, the body, responsibility, and social justice among other beliefs.  Then, they were explicit about their rationale.  Now it is just accepted as natural behavior.

And it is the people brought up to believe in the lessons of individualism through privately possessing one’s own space, as psychologically and physically essential for health, who write the policies, and who decide what is, indeed, reasonable to the ordinary person – and who decide what that ordinary person looks like.  In actual number, I would guess that the ordinary person they are talking about is in the minority, leaving out most ethnic groups, of all colors.

…What is needed is more discussion about reframing the definition of national origin to include what it means to be from a particular geographic locale within the context of understanding the intimate connections between social and spatial relations in the home, at the levels of the individual, the household, and of the larger society of which they are a part.  And then to accept the preference for sharing as equally legitimate as the preference for privacy.  To do less than this is being complicit in discriminatory housing policies.

…Sometimes I wonder what current debates would look like if the dominant mindset was [different].  Would more people be housed?  Would extended families and large families have greater opportunity to select where they want to live?  Would apartment developers move from the current trend of emphasizing two-bedroom units (which under current regulations tend to have the effect of eliminating many families with children) to larger ones to allow more nuclear and extended households to find housing of choice?”

I told you Ms. Pader was loquacious!  That said, her paper illuminates much little-known history and purports some challenging, if not compelling, arguments.

  The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) of 1968 coupled with the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988 protected the following classes in a housing:  race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (children), and disability.  Oregon law also protects marital status, source of income, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors.  Washington law covers martial status, sexual orientation, and domestic violence survivors, and honorably discharged veterans / military status. Additional protected classes have been added in particular geographic areas; visit FHCO.org/mission.htm and read the section entitled “View Local Protected Classes” for more information.
2 At the Fair Housing Council (FHCO), we have long recommended a policy of two individuals per bedroom plus one more individual for the unit. For example, a housing provider might limit a two bedroom-home to five individuals. This ""two plus one"" formula can help insulate the housing provider from fair housing violations based on occupancy in most situations. That being said, additional factors should always be considered in developing individual policies.

"480","480","3","Phil Querin Q&A Is Domestic Violence a Defense to Non-Payment of Rent?","Question:  I have a tenant that I issued a 72 Hour Non-Payment of Rent notice to last month. When I served it she told me that she is a victim of domestic violence and would provide me a copy of the restraining order, she also told me that she would have her attorney contact me. Neither occurred. She paid her rent by the final date on the notice. She hasn't paid rent yet this month. I still have no copies of a restraining order, nor has her husband informed me that he has moved out. She is the only one to tell me about domestic violence. I just served her with another 72 hour notice. She is upset and yelled that I can't evict her because she is still dealing with issues as a victim of domestic violence. She also told me that she now has two attorneys and that she will have them both call me. I informed her to read the notice carefully as rent will need to be paid by the 13th or I would file in court on the 14th.
My question is this: Is domestic violence a recognized defense to non-payment of rent?

Answer: Domestic violence is a defense to eviction, but only under the proper circumstances.  I have set out the law in its entirety below. As you can see, the law presumes there has been a violent act for which the landlord is evicting everyone in the space, i.e. the villain and the victim.  The domestic violence law says you cannot evict the victim for the violent act. But it also says the villain and the victim are still responsible for rent.  It also requires a valid third-party affirmation to the event.  

In short, based on your question, it does not sound as if the domestic violence statute will provide a defense to an action for nonpayment of rent.  You should tell the victim that you do not believe the domestic violence law applies in these circumstances (i.e. nonpayment of rent) and that if her attorney believes otherwise, he must call you immediately and explain why. Is she is a serial late pay for which you have to issue multiple non-payment of rent notices, you might consider a 3-strikes notice under ORS 90.630(8).

1. Do we write a new lease for the remaining resident or keep the old lease with both residents on the lease? 

A new lease would presumably require than any new occupants be qualified all over again. But the current occupant would not qualify.  Secondly, the ex-spouse would have no liability for space rent going forward.  You may want to leave the status quo, to keep your options opened.

2. Can we legally keep the resident that moved out, responsible for the lease after a divorce and separation of assets?  Yes.

3. Do we re-screen the remaining resident to see if he/she qualifies on their own?  

I have a concern about doing so – if they did not pass the credit requirements, then what?  You can’t evict them without cause, and as long as the remaining occupant is current, you could not do so.  Besides, if the remaining occupant is receiving spousal or child support, their income might be sufficient.

4. Who owns the security deposit or pre-paid rent?  

I don’t think you have a duty to refund any deposits until the tenancy is ended, and so far, that isn’t the case. If and when it is ended, you could ask for joint instructions from both of them, and if they can’t agree, make the check out to them jointly.

"484","484","3","Manufactured Home Dealer's License - What You Need to Know","Do I need a license to sell manufactured homes?

Yes. Individuals or entities that sell a manufactured home on behalf of another person have always required a license.
 
If I am a licensed real estate agent, can I sell manufactured homes?

In some cases, real estate brokers will need an MSD license. If a manufactured structure is sold separate from the sale of the land, this is considered a personal property transaction and requires an MSD license. The sale of a manufactured structure and land in a single transaction is a real estate transaction and requires a real estate license (but not an MSD license).
 
I sell Park Model structures. Do I need a DFCS dealer's license to sell these structures?

Yes. Except for person-to-person sales, any individual or entity engaged in selling manufactured homes is required to get a license. If you are a park owner and you sell less than 10 manufactured homes in a year, you may apply for a limited license. You can apply for either license online at https://licensesonline.dcbs.oregon.gov/MyLicense Enterprise/
 
What is the purpose of a limited dealer's license?

The limited license allows a park owner to sell up to ten homes per year within the licensee's park without having to obtain a full dealer license. ORS 446.706
 
What are the bonding requirements for a manufactured structures dealer?

A bond or letter of credit is required before a license is issued. The bond must be submitted with your application on a Division of Finance and Corporate Securities surety bond form (Form 440-2966) .
 
How do I apply for a manufactured structures dealer license?

To apply for a regular or a limited license, submit a completed application form to the Division of Finance and Corporate Securities. Alternatively, you can take advantage of the department's online licensing system - License 2000/My License. This system provides licensees a robust set of tools to apply for, renew, update, or check license status via the web. More information can be found online at https://licensesonline.dcbs.oregon.gov/MyLicense Enterprise/.
 
How do I make changes to my manufactured structures dealer license?

If dealers need to change the street address, mailing address, or the DBA or ABN on their license, a correction to the license must be submitted and a $30 fee applies. Please note, the legal name on the license cannot be changed, only the DBA or ABN.
 
As a dealership, if I want to open another sales center, do I need another license?

Dealer licenses are good for one location only. If a dealer has, or intends to open, a branch office at a different location under the same business name and license, the dealer must apply for a supplemental license.
 
Does a dealer need a trip permit to move a new home between dealer inventory lots?

No. New homes identified as dealer inventory may be moved between a dealer's inventory lots provided the dealer has obtained a supplemental dealer license for the lots in question. Please note that a trip permit is required whenever a used home is moved from one site or dealer location to another.
 
As a dealer, am I subject to taxation on a home I have installed as a spec home?

If you have a supplemental license for the home's location, the home is considered inventory.
See ORS 446.576
 
How should a dealer handle a spec home that is placed in a manufactured home park?

The statute makes provisions for a dealer to license a park as a dealer site from which the home can be sold. In essence, this means that the initial placement of a spec home on a lot in a park, before it has actually been sold, would be viewed as movement from a dealer lot to a dealer lot.
 
Can an Escrow Agent complete the sales transaction of a manufactured structure on behalf of my dealership?

Yes, provided the conditions specified in ORS 446.591 are met.

"485","485","3","Recreational Vehicle Question and Answer with Attorney Mark Busch - RV Tenant Eviction","By Mark L. Busch, P.C., Attorney at Law

Question: How does the eviction process work when evicting an RV tenant?  Is it different than evicting a manufactured home community resident?

Answer:  The process for evicting an RV tenant is the same process used for evicting most tenants in any setting.  Nearly every eviction begins with an eviction notice, which must be properly served on the RV tenant. “Proper service” under Oregon law means that the eviction notice must be either (1) personally served, (2) mailed by first class mail, or (3) posted and mailed (if allowed by the rental agreement).  

I recommend that if the RV tenant has an individual mailbox at the park, eviction notices should be mailed with at least 3 days added for mailing time.  If the tenant does not have mail service at the park, or if the mail goes through the park office for RV tenants, then personally serve the notice by putting it in his or her hand.  “Posting and mailing” as a method of service should be avoided, since there must be very specific language in the rental agreement allowing such service.

Most notices give the tenant a certain amount of time to remedy a default (i.e., 72 hours to pay past-due  rent), followed by a tenancy termination deadline if the default isn't remedied. Other notices can't be remedied (i.e., a 24-hour notice for outrageous conduct) and simply inform the tenant that they must vacate by a certain time and date.  RV tenants can also be evicted with a 30-day, no-cause notice if they have been in the park less than a year.  Anything over a year requires a 60-day notice to evict without cause.

The one special circumstance for evicting an RV that does not require service of a notice is the so-called “midnight move-in.”  This occurs when an RV simply drives onto a space in the park without the prior consent of the landlord.  When that happens and the RV owner refuses to vacate immediately, the landlord can simply file an eviction case without needing to serve any notice.
In all other cases, after an eviction notice expires and the RV tenant fails to vacate, the landlord will need to file an eviction lawsuit at the local county courthouse. The eviction lawsuit is sometimes referred to as an ""FED"" (""Forcible Entry and Detainer""). The tenant will be served with an eviction summons and complaint and be required to appear in court. 

As the landlord, you will also need to appear in court unless you have an attorney or other agent (such as a property  manager) appear in court at the ""1st appearance hearing."" This hearing is usually set 8 days after the FED is filed. The purpose of the hearing is to see whether the parties can work out a payment plan, move-out agreement, or other arrangement. If not, the case will be set for trial. 

If you are unable to settle the case at the first appearance hearing, by law the trial must be scheduled within 15 days from the 1st appearance hearing. Sometimes, the parties or the court will delay the trial beyond  this time frame, but most cases move quickly. This leaves little time for preparation, meaning it is important to have your witnesses, exhibits, and trial arguments ready to go. 
You do not necessarily need an attorney for court appearances, but you will increase your chance of success if you do. The eviction statutes are very technical, and  most  people aren't  familiar with courtroom procedures. You will especially be at a disadvantage if the RV tenant has an attorney. If your case gets to the point of a trial, it is usually worth it to hire an attorney.

(Editor's Note:  MHCO has been working with the Oregon Congressional Delegation to move this Federal Legislaton forward in Washington DC.  If you contacts with any of the members or staff of the Oregon Congressional delegation please let the MHCO office know.  This is a very important piece of Federal Legislation and we do not want to miss any opportunity to help pass this legislation.  Thank you.) 

On May 15th, the Senate Banking Committee approved legislation (currently unnumbered) on a 13-9 vote that would eliminate Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and overhaul the nation's secondary housing finance market.

The bill, authored by Chairman Tim Johnson (D-SD) and ranking member Mike Crapo (R-ID), now moves to the full Senate. A floor vote this year appears unlikely after several key Democrats on the panel voted against the plan out of concern that it goes too far in eliminating the current system and does not do enough to preserve affordable housing finance options.

The bill expands on legislation introduced last year by Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Mark Warner (D-VA) and replaces Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a system where the government would explicitly guarantee big losses in the housing market but that relies on the private sector to play a larger role than it currently does in funding new mortgages.

Included in the Johnson-Crapo bill are provisions explicitly requested by MHI that would allow manufactured home loans, including those secured by personal property, full access to the newly envisioned secondary market system.

Included in the legislation is a provision requiring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to review the impact HOEPA High-Cost Mortgage and Loan Originator provisions are having on credit availability in the manufactured housing market. The language also directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to complete a study on how these provisions impact credit available to those seeking to purchase manufactured housing. The provisions, which were requested by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), were adopted during mark up. 

Despite strong objections from majority members of the committee over any efforts to include Dodd-Frank-related amendments, the Manchin provisions represented a compromise approach and will serve to ensure that the CFPB remains focused on the need to provide the manufactured housing market with relief from recent rulemakings.

Committee Prepares for Recorded Vote on Manufactured Housing Legislation

On May 22nd, the House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to take recorded votes on a number of measures reforming portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Included in this will be the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act (H.R. 1779). 

The committee marked up a number of measures on May 7th. H.R. 1779 was approved by voice vote, but a recorded vote was requested. While the measure is expected to formally be approved by the committee next week, the recorded vote is an opportunity to underscore the bipartisan support that exists for the bill. Once approved by the committee, the measure will await floor consideration.

During the mark up, the measure received bipartisan support from the committee's ranking member Maxine Waters (D-CA) and bill cosponsor Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL). Others speaking in strong support of the measure included Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) and Reps. Andy Barr (R-KY), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Steve Pearce (R-NM).

The bill would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) to change the criteria by which home loans are classified ""high-cost"" while keeping in place strong consumer protections. Sponsored by Representatives Stephen Fincher (R-TN), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), and Gary Miller (R-CA), the bill is cosponsored by 113 House Members on both sides of the aisle. 

The legislation would also clarify that manufactured home retailers and salespersons would not be considered loan originators unless they receive compensation from a lender, mortgage broker or loan originator. The CFPB ""loan originator"" definition effective since January, is based on traditional mortgage market roles that do not equate with the business model of the manufactured housing industry, including lending and retail sales practices. Without this clarification, manufactured home buyers will be unable to receive guidance on the limited manufactured home financing resources available.

She says they are coming from the ground around the home and has had an exterminator out who confirms that the infestation is coming from the ground.  The resident demands that we pay for the exterminator and that the infestation be controlled at the expense of management. WE do not believe it is our responsibility.  What are your thoughts?

Answer:  As to whether you or the resident is responsible for the condition of the ground upon which the home sits, it depends on whether the infestation existed at the time of commencement of the tenancy. If “yes,” the it’s your responsibility to abate; if “no” then it’s the tenant’s responsibility.  Here is a summary of the applicable statute.  I have highlighted that portion of the law which applies to your issue:

ORS 90.730 [Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition.] provides in relevant part:

•	A landlord who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling shall at all times during the tenancy maintain the rented space, vacant spaces in the facility and the facility common areas in a habitable condition.
•	The landlord does not have a duty to maintain a dwelling or home.
•	A landlord’s habitability duty includes only the following:
o	A sewage disposal system and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the sewage disposal system can be controlled by the landlord;
o	If required by applicable law, a drainage system reasonably capable of disposing of storm water, ground water and subsurface water, approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order;
o	A water supply and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained so as to provide safe drinking water and to be in good working order to the extent that the water supply system can be controlled by the landlord;
o	An electrical supply and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the electrical supply system can be controlled by the landlord;
o	At the time of commencement of the rental agreement, buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin;
o	Except as otherwise provided by local ordinance or by written agreement between the landlord and the tenant, an adequate number of appropriate receptacles for garbage and rubbish in clean condition and good repair at the time of commencement of the rental agreement, and for which the landlord shall provide and maintain appropriate serviceable receptacles thereafter and arrange for their removal; and
o	Completion of any landlord-provided space improvements, including but not limited to installation of carports, garages, driveways and sidewalks, approved under applicable law at the time of installation.
•	 A rented space is considered unhabitable if the landlord does not maintain a hazard tree as required by ORS 90.727. 
•	A vacant space in a facility is considered unhabitable if the space substantially lacks safety from the hazards of fire or injury.
•	A facility common area is considered unhabitable if it substantially lacks:
o	 Buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin;
o	Safety from the hazards of fire;
o	Trees, shrubbery and grass maintained in a safe manner; and 
o	If supplied or required to be supplied by the landlord to a common area, a water supply system, sewage disposal system or system for disposing of storm water, ground water and subsurface water approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the system can be controlled by the landlord.
•	 Note that the landlord and tenant may agree in writing that the tenant is to perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks and minor remodeling only if:
o	The agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord;
o	The agreement does not diminish the obligations of the landlord to other tenants on the premises; and 
o	The terms and conditions of the agreement are clearly and fairly disclosed and adequate consideration for the agreement is specifically stated.  

The term “vermin” is defined as:  “Small insects and animals (such as fleas or mice) that are sometimes harmful to plants or other animals and that are difficult to get rid of.” [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vermin] That’s a pretty broad definition, and I’m going to assume that “vermin” include ants.  So the question is, was this condition one that existed at the commencement of the tenancy?  If the resident had been at the space for years and never complained until now, I suspect they [or their exterminator] would have a tough time establishing when the problem first occurred.  As you know, pests come and go; they could be seasonal, weather related, food related, hygiene related, etc.

Chances are that if one resident has ants, others may as well.  Had the resident come to you before hiring the exterminator, I would have suggested that you find out how widespread the problem was, and if it was prevalent throughout the community [or a specific area within the community] perhaps work out some cost-sharing arrangement along with a periodic maintenance schedule to eradicate the problem. That was not done here.   

However, good community relations suggests that you find out the breadth of the problem, and if it affects several residents, discuss a solution with all of them that works for your pocketbook, and the residents’ budget. Whether you pay for the exterminator for one resident, might set a bad precedent, since it could encourage others to do the same.  That’s why you want to find out the scope of the problem.

"489","489","3","MEASURE TO PRESERVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MANUFACTURED HOUSING  CLEARS KEY HURDLE IN U.S. HOUSE","The House Financial Services Committee Passes Bipartisan Legislation to Protect the Availability of Financing for Manufactured Homes

(Editor's Note:  As mentioned in the earlier article with the passage of similar legislation pending in the US Senate, MHCO is working with the Oregon Congressional delegation to ensure passage of this critical legislation.)

Washington, DC - The U.S. House Financial Services Committee today passed the bipartisan Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act (H.R. 1779) to protect the ability of manufactured home customers to buy, sell and refinance affordable manufactured homes, the largest form of unsubsidized affordable housing in the nation. Specifically, the bill would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) to address the criteria by which home loans are classified ""high-cost"" while keeping in place strong consumer protections. Sponsored by Representatives Stephen Fincher (R-TN), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), and Gary Miller (R-CA), the bill is also supported and cosponsored by an additional 110 House Members on both sides of the aisle. 

""The ability to access affordable manufactured homes is vital to millions of low- and moderate-income Americans, and our industry is also an important economic driver and job creator in many communities across the country,"" said Nathan Smith, Chairman of the Manufactured Housing Institute. ""This legislation would ensure that manufactured housing remains a viable affordable housing option, particularly in rural, distressed and underserved areas. We urge the full House of Representative to move swiftly to consider this important legislation.""

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), through a rulemaking process required under Dodd-Frank, deemed that all purchase loans-including mortgages on manufactured homes considered personal property-be covered by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). Under these guidelines, many small-balance loans used for the purchase of affordable manufactured housing are now unfairly classified as predatory and high-cost. Unfortunately, the CFPB failed to recognize the uniqueness of manufactured home loans compared to the rest of the housing industry.

While the cost of originating and servicing a $250,000 loan and a $25,000 loan are the same in terms of real dollars, the cost as a percentage of each loan's size is significantly different. This difference causes the smaller-sized manufactured home loan to potentially exceed the new thresholds and be categorized as a HOEPA high-cost loan. 

Due to the increased lender liabilities associated with making a HOEPA high-cost loan, it is unlikely that these loans will be offered to homebuyers, denying access to necessary credit for new and existing manufactured homes. In fact, industry lenders have already stopped originating loans of less than $20,000 as a result of the new rule. According to the American Housing Survey, roughly half of the nation's 8.5 million manufactured homes have a purchase price of less than $30,000.

Manufactured home loans perform just as well, if not better, than loans on site-built counterparts and are serviced in a responsible and consumer-friendly manner. This is evidenced by delinquency rates among manufactured housing lenders that are half of what is reported in the larger mortgage market. 

Eliminating this important source of financing would unfairly penalize low and moderate-income homebuyers who do not qualify for traditional mortgage financing needed for single family home ownership; do not have access to limited government-insured and GSE secondary market programs; or live in rural areas where affordable rental housing is scarce or non-existent. Additionally, millions of families could see the equity they have diligently built up in their manufactured homes wiped out because lenders would be unwilling to provide the financing needed for resale.

""Homeowners who purchased safe, energy efficient homes that they can afford rather than taking out a loan they could not pay back should not be punished, and we are thankful so many lawmakers have backed this effort to protect the more than 22 million Americans living in manufactured homes,"" added Smith.

The bipartisan legislation would also clarify that manufactured home retailers and salespersons would not be considered loan originators unless they receive compensation from a lender, mortgage broker or loan originator. The new CFPB definition of a loan originator is based on traditional mortgage market roles that do not equate with the business model of the manufactured housing industry, including lending and retail sales practices. 

A similar bipartisan bill has been introduced in the Senate, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2013 (S. 1828), by Senators Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Tom Coburn (R-OK).

1.	Change ORS 90.675 (14) (c)  to allow county tax collector to cancel all unpaid property taxes when the landlord purchases the home through the abandonment sale.  Current Law: Landlord’s who bid at the auction of a home with a tax assessor determined fair market value in excess of $8,000, should plan on paying the unpaid property taxes if they acquire the home at the sale, since those taxes will not be cancelled.

2.	Clarify that any home removed or destroyed in a manufactured home community can be replaced with an equivalent new or used home with no interference by state or local jurisdictions.  This includes no new or additional infrastructure improvements, system development charges and fees.
3. 	Allow manufactured home communities that provide well water to charge for water usage via water sub-metering.
4.	 Local jurisdictions must charge landlord the lesser of either  commercial or residential rates for the master meter consumption, following the installation and operation of water sub-meters.  (more of a Tenant issue, but shows ‘we care’)

5.  Provide Landlord “First Right of Refusal” on tenant home sales, written in the rental agreement – identical to Tenants right of refusal to purchase the park

6. Exclude charges due under a rental or lease agreement from being “waivable”.

7.  Exempt Landlords from all past due tax liability of abandoned homes.

8.  Make 90.600 5a clear that the Committee of 7 must designate and inform community management who the Committee has selected as the “spokesperson”, and whoever they designate is the only member permitted to offer management written or verbal communication outside of the up to 2 annual committee meetings with management.  Secondly, require the election of the Committee of 7 to be “certified”.

9.	Provide landlord the right to line item veto failed rules and regulations proposed.  Tenants must specify rule changes they oppose and support.

10 .Provide Landlord unilateral amendment of park rules and regulations of changes required by statute.

11.	 Revisit subsequent sale and/or forced removal

12.  Uninsurable Homes -- permit Landlords ""subsequent sale""

13.  Revoke rule writing for OHCS – consider prohibiting.

14.  Live-in Care Providers -- consider Washington RCW59.20.145: A tenant in a mobile home park may share his or her mobile home, manufactured home, or park model with any person over eighteen years of age, if that person is providing live-in home health care or live-in hospice care to the tenant under an approved plan of treatment ordered by the tenant's physician. The live-in care provider is not considered a tenant of the park and shall have no rights of tenancy in the park. Any agreement between the tenant and the live-in care provider does not change the terms and conditions of the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant. The live-in care provider shall comply with the rules of the mobile home park, the rental agreement, and this chapter. The landlord may not charge a guest fee for the live-in care provider.  It could also be the same as California law, but should include a written and approved treatment plan, and the expected duration.

15.  Landlord receives one-year property tax exemption, the year following installation and operation of water sub-meters.

"494","494","3","Phil Querin Q&A Fees Against Tenants Who Violate the Rules","Question: I understand that the Oregon statutes now permit landlords to levy fines against tenants who
violate the rules. Where is the statute and what does it say?

Answer: The statute you are referring to is 90.302, and it provides the following:

• A landlord may charge a tenant a fee for each occurrence of the following:
o A late rent payment;
o A dishonored check;
o Removal or tampering with a properly functioning smoke alarm,smoke detector or
carbon monoxide alarm;
o The violation of a written pet agreement or of a rule relating to pets in a facility;
o The abandonment or relinquishment of a dwelling unit during a fixed term tenancy
without cause;
• A landlord may charge a tenant a fee for a second noncompliance or for a subsequent
noncompliance with written rules or policies that describe the prohibited conduct and the fee for a second noncompliance, and for any third or subsequent noncompliance, that occurs within one year after a written warning notice.
o The fee may not exceed $50 for the second noncompliance within one year after the warning notice for the same or a similar noncompliance or
o $50 plus five percent of the rent payment for the current rental period for a third or subsequent noncompliance within one year after the warning notice for the same or a similar noncompliance.
• The landlord must:
o Give the tenant a written warning notice that describes:
 A specific noncompliance before charging a fee for a second or subsequent
noncompliance for the same or similar conduct; and
 The amount of the fee for a second noncompliance, and for any subsequent
noncompliance, that occurs within one year after the warning notice. Give a tenant a written notice describing the noncompliance when assessing a fee for a second or subsequent noncompliance that occurs within one year after the warning notice. Give a warning notice for a noncompliance or assess a fee for a second or subsequent noncompliance within 30 days after the act constituting noncompliance.
• The landlord may terminate a tenancy for a noncompliance instead of assessing a fee, but may not assess a fee and terminate a tenancy for the same noncompliance.
• The landlord may not deduct a fee from a rent payment for the current or a subsequent rental period.
• The landlord may charge a tenant a fee for occurrences of noncompliance with written rules or policies as provided above for the following types of noncompliance:
o The late payment to futility or service charge that the tenant owes the landlord; 
o The failure to clean up pet waste from the space;
o The failure to clean up garbage,rubbish and other waste from the space;
o For parking violations;
o For the improper use of vehicles within the premises;
o For smoking in a clearly designated nonsmoking area within the community other than
the home;
1
o For keeping an unauthorized pet capable of causing damage to persons or property.
• The landlord is not be required to account for or return to any fees to the tenant.
• Other than for early termination of a fixed term lease (discussed above) a landlord may not
charge a tenant any form of liquidated damages, however designated.
• Nonpayment of a fee is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent (i.e. under ORS 90.394), but is grounds for a 30-day notice of termination for cause under
90.630 (1).
• This law does not apply to:
o Attorneyfeesawarded;
o Applicant screening charges;
o Charges for improvements or other actions that are requested by the tenant and are not
required under the rental agreement or by law, including the cost to replace a key lost
by a tenant;
o Processing fees charged to the landlord by a credit card company and passed through to
the tenant for the use of a credit card by the tenant to make a payment when:
 The credit card company allows processing fees to be passed through to the
credit card holder; and
 The landlord allows the tenant to pay in cash or by check; or
 A requirement by a landlord in a written rental agreement that a tenant obtain
and maintain renter’s liability insurance.
• NOTE: The fees must be described in a written rental agreement.
o Since ORS90.100(38)defines“rental agreement”to mean“…all agreements,written or oral, and valid rules and regulations, it would seem that including the fines in the rules would suffice.

"495","495","3","RV Park Question and Answer with Attorney Mark Busch - Discrimination Claims by RV Tenants","By Mark L. Busch, P.C., Attorney at Law

Question: A manufactured home community has an RV section.  Community management is aware that the Federal Fair Housing laws apply to manufactured home community tenants and that the community cannot discriminate against protected groups when renting manufactured home spaces.  Do the same laws apply to RV tenants?  Does it matter if they are short-term vacation occupancy RVs as opposed to longer term space rental RVs?

Answer: Generally the short answer is yes, the Federal Fair Housing laws apply to RV rentals.  It also does not matter whether the RV rental is a vacation occupancy rental or a long-term rental.  The discrimination laws apply either way.

Specifically, the Federal Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) prohibits discrimination in the rental of a “dwelling” based upon race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.  ""Dwelling"" includes any vacant land which is offered for lease for locating any “structure” on it. A structure would include an RV.

(Note:  State fair housing statutes also protect against discrimination based upon race, color, sex, marital status, source of income (excluding Section 8), familial status, religion, national origin, and disability.   Some local ordinances [e.g., Portland and Eugene] protect against discrimination based upon age and sexual orientation.) 

As such, and as an initial matter, landlords should avoid asking any questions of RV rental applicants related to these prohibited areas.  The sole exception may be the age of a potential applicant if the RV section qualifies as a “55 or older” facility under the Federal Fair Housing Act.  The qualifications for “55 or older” housing are very strict and you should always check with your attorney before asking age-related questions on your rental application.  

During an RV tenancy, landlords must also be careful to avoid anything that might be interpreted as discriminatory. For example, rent increases should typically be made across the board to avoid discrimination allegations.  Another thing to avoid is the uneven enforcement of your rules and regulations.  Every RV tenant should be held equally accountable to follow the rules, and appropriate notices should be issued to every tenant who violates the rules to leave no room for any discrimination claims.
 
Reasonable Accommodation

The Fair Housing Act also prohibits acts that “discriminate against any person… in the provision of services or facilities in connection with [a] dwelling, because of a handicap of that person or any person associated with that person.”  The FHA defines discrimination as “a refusal to make reasonable accommodation in its rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a [disabled] person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.”  The FHA obligates landlords to make “reasonable accommodations” in the “rules, policies, practices, or services,” necessary to afford handicapped persons “equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.”

This means that if an RV tenant requests an “accommodation” for his or her handicap, the landlord is obligated to provide it unless it causes a financial or administrative burden.  A typical example might be if a handicapped RV tenant requested an RV rental space closest to the park’s RV restrooms/showers.  In most cases, the landlord would need to accommodate this request if it were possible to accommodate the request without causing a “burden.”

However, landlords need not provide housing to individuals whose “tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.”  A good example of this would be if an RV tenant requested to keep a pit bull as a “companion animal.”  In most instances, the landlord would be justified in rejecting this request since pit bulls are generally considered a dangerous breed.

"496","496","3","Legislative Update:  MHCO Pushes Tax Reform in MH Abandonment","Last month the 2014-15 Manufactured Housing Landlord-Tenant Coalition held it’s first meeting in preparation for the 2015 Oregon Legislative Session.  The “coalition” meets once a month to discuss issues impacting manufactured home communities and has drafted legislation for each of the past Oregon Legislative session since the mid 1990’s.  MHCO is a regular participant with 4-5 MHCO Board members in attendance.  Other participants include resident organization, government agencies, home manufacturers and finance companies.

One of MHCO’s top priorities (see “Legislative Wish List” posted 5-28-14)  is to change ORS 90.675 (14) (c) to allow county tax collector to cancel all unpaid property taxes when the community owner (landlord) purchases the home.  MHCO raised the issue at the May 28th meeting. There is a reasonably good chance that some changes to the statute.  The extent of those changes will be negotiated in the months to come.

Here is a brief summary of last month’s meeting:

1.	With David Tatman from the Oregon Department of Business and Consumer Services, we discussed a concern about possible conflicts of interest between park residents trying to sell their homes in place and park owners or managers who sell homes – both on behalf of others and homes that they own – via a limited dealer license. This issue can be complicated by deferred maintenance on the home for sale. The coalition agreed to outline the issue for our next meeting, for continued discussion.

2.     With Diane Belt, Washington County Assessment & Taxation, and Tami Little of Clackamas County, we talked about the issue of unpaid back taxes owed on abandoned homes; current law causes landlords to demolish or give away low-cost homes with big tax arrearages, bigger than the value of the home, instead of allowing those homes to continue to provide affordable housing and rents. At MHCO's request the coalition agreed to outline the issue, in the context of existing ORS 90.675 (14) (c). Diane agreed to talk to the tax collectors. Also to be continued.

3.     Also with Diane Belt, we discussed the concern by some counties, Multnomah in particular, over their statutory duty to collect the $6 assessment on MHs, that supports the Manufactured Communities Resource Center at OHCS. There are several reasons why counties have concerns, including the cost to bill and collect this fee, especially in the four counties where low value manufactured homes are exempt from property taxes. Is there some other collection mechanism? Ken Pryor will get us up-to-date numbers on revenues from the #6 assessment and costs for MCRC. Diane will talk to some other assessors about what it would take to cover the counties’ costs (if we were to raise the fee).

One toke over the line
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line” ~ Brewer & Shipley, 1971.

Background. Landlords in Oregon are understandably flummoxed by the new prescription drug du jour, medical marijuana.  Why? Because, while Oregon permits the medical use of marijuana, the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801, et seq., says that it is illegal to manufacture, distribute, and possess marijuana, even when state law authorizes its use. Furthermore, federal law supersedes state law where there is a direct conflict between them.  So, what does a landlord do when confronted by a card-carrying tenant claiming that he/she cannot be evicted for marijuana use and/or cultivation, because they have a legal right to do so under Oregon law.  To second arrow in the tenant’s quiver is the threat that “if you try to evict me, I will sue you under the federal Fair Housing laws  that say you must grant me a reasonable accommodation  [i.e. let me toke on the premises] because I have a “disability.”  

Discussion. Clearly, this is a very complicated issue on several levels.  Marijuana is a controlled substance under Federal Law, but under Oregon law, its use and cultivation in limited amounts are lawful with a medical marijuana card. The Oregon laws cover such things as grow-site registration; medical uses for marijuana; issuance of an identification card; and limitations on a cardholder’s immunity from criminal laws involving marijuana.  For those interested, the specific statutes should be consulted here. 

Based upon recent news reports, it appears that, subject to certain exceptions,  there will be no effort by the federal Department of Justice to seek out and charge violators of the Controlled Substances Act in those states where the medical or recreational use of marijuana are legal.

The Conundrum.  In short, it appears that when it comes to enforcement of their rules and regulations, Oregon landlords are on their own; neither the feds, nor the state, will go after persons with lawfully issued medical marijuana cards. Furthermore, if a tenant has a valid card, then arguably he or she has some medical condition that has authorized its issuance. Is the landlord obligated under the Fair Housing laws to make a “reasonable accommodation” for their medical condition, and permit the tenant to continue their use or grow operation?   If properly done, the answer may be “No.” Here’s  why: 

In January 20, 2011, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) issued a Memorandum, the subject of which was “Medical Use of Marijuana and Reasonable Accommodation in Federal Public and Assisted Housing.” While the Memo was limited to federal public and assisted housing, it can be regarded as a helpful – though perhaps not a “final” resource – on the issue.   It is very complete and helpful for all landlords. It can be found at this link. Here is what the Memo directs:

Public housing agencies “…in states that have enacted laws legalizing the use of medical marijuana must therefore establish a standard and adopt written policy regarding whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance for residents who are medical marijuana users.  The decision of whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance to medical marijuana users is the responsibility of PHAs, not of the Department.” 

Thus, HUD appears to be leaving it up to the state public housing authorities to decide whether the refusal to permit on-premises use of medical marijuana constitutes a fair housing violation. Between the lines, it appears that HUD will not directly investigate such claims, leaving it up to public housing agencies on the state level.  

While HUD’s pronouncement is directed toward “public housing” is would be hard to believe private housing would be treated any differently.  Oregon fair housing law is ""substantially equivalent"" to federal fair housing law.  So, generally speaking, on the issue of medical marijuana, as goes the federal law, so goes state law.  

However, in the 2010 case of Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, the Oregon Supreme Court held that employers do not have a legal  duty to allow employees to use medical marijuana on the job.  This case addressed many unanswered questions on the use of medical marijuana in Oregon, both from an employment and housing perspective. Additionally, a subsequent article [found here] by the Fair Housing Council of Oregon is helpful for landlords from the view of private fair housing enforcement. 

Thus, it appears that in Oregon, on both the federal and state levels, enforcement agencies are [for the time being at least] taking a laissez-faire approach to the medical marijuana issue. This means that landlords have it within their control, with little fear of a fair housing/reasonable accommodation claim, to enact rules and regulations prohibiting the on-premises use of medical marijuana. However, the proscription should not be retroactive to tenants holding legal medical marijuana cards who have already signed their rental agreements or leases.  
Oregon Landlord-Tenant Laws.  Oregon statutes permit landlords to enforce tenant violations of their rental agreements, rules, and general laws [not just the landlord-tenant laws]. It is my belief that the violation of a no medical marijuana policy would be enforceable on a going forward basis. The policy should not be retroactive – and it should so state.

In summary,  ORS 90.630 [Termination by Landlord] provides as follow:

•	After delivery of written notice, a landlord may terminate the rental agreement for cause and take possession in accordance with the state eviction laws [ORS 105.105 to 105.168], unless the tenant cures the violation.
•	Causes for termination are:
o	Material violations of the rental agreement;
o	Material violation by the tenant of his/her legal duties under [ORS 90.740];
o	Failure to pay rent.
•	The landlord’s notice to the tenant must:
o	Specify the acts and omissions constituting the violation;
o	State that the rental agreement will terminate upon a designated date not less than 30 days after delivery of the notice; and 
o	If the violation may be cured under the law, so state and describe at least one possible remedy to cure it, designating the date by which the cure must occur.
•	If the violation described in the notice can be cured, and is cured by the designated date, the tenancy will not terminate; 
•	 If the tenant does not cure the violation, the rental agreement terminates as provided in the notice. 
•	If the cause of a written notice relates to substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior violation for which notice was given within the previous six months, the designated termination date must be not less than 20 days after delivery of the notice and no earlier than the designated termination date stated in the previously given notice. The tenant does not have a right to cure this subsequent violation. 

Miscellaneous Tips.  Landlords, read the medical marijuana card!   It must valid and current for Oregon.  A California card, for example, would not suffice.  [See, State v. Berrenger, 2010]. If there is no card, or no current card, the growing [not use] of marijuana may still be a violation of Oregon law.  In such cases, issuance of a curable 30-day notice under ORS 90.630 may be appropriate. If other tenants are complaining about the odor [and many do], a landlord may consider looking to the “quiet enjoyment” provisions of the rental agreement, the rules, or the provisions in ORS 90.740(4)(i). 

Conclusion. Rental management companies and individual landlords in Oregon may wish to institute a written medical marijuana policy in their rules and/or rental agreements, dealing both with use and cultivation. Based upon current federal law, it does not appear to be a fair housing violation to prohibit medical marijuana in the landlord’s rental agreement or rules. If such a policy exists, it should include management’s right to decline a request for a reasonable accommodation.  


Remember, besides nonpayment of rent, there are only three ways to terminate a tenancy for cause: 
•	Violation of the rental/lease agreement; 
•	Violation of the rules; and 
•	Violation of Oregon laws. 

This means that in Oregon, if a tenant engages in the legal use or cultivation of marijuana – i.e. with a valid card – doing so is not a violation of state law. If a landlord seeks to prevent such activity, the answer must then be found, if at all, in the rental agreement or the rules.  Without an express prohibition contained in one of these documents, it may be difficult to bring an eviction action for legal marijuana use or cultivation – unless the tenant’s conduct violates some other rule or provision in the rental agreement.
