"218","218","3","Phil Querin Q&A   Resident Couple Divorces - One Moves Out - How to Document","<p>Question:  A few years ago, a married couple originally applied together for residency in our community.  Based on their combined credit scores, they were both approved for residency.  They have since divorced and one of them has moved out.  How do we deal with this?</p>
<p>We have several questions listed below. Answer:  First, please understand that Oregon law does not directly deal with this – and neither is it addressed in most rental/lease agreements, including MHCO’s.  So my responses are based upon my opinion alone.  Until an appellate court rules on these issues – which is unlikely, since most such cases are never appealed - the best we can do is speculate. My answers are in italics below.</p>
<p>1. Do we write a new lease for the remaining resident or keep the old lease with both residents on the lease?</p>
<p><em>I think I would prefer to see a new lease signed by the remaining resident – even if title remains in both their names. That way, the ex-spouse cannot argue that he or she has a right of occupancy a year or two down the road, when they patch things up, or one moves out and the other moves back in.  A new lease would require than any new occupants be qualified all over again. Note that if the lease is changed into the name of the remaining resident, the ex-spouse would certainly have no liability for space rent going forward.</em></p>
<p>2. Can we legally keep the resident that moved out, responsible for the lease after a divorce and separation of assets?</p>
<p><em>Technically, yes.  Neither the divorce decree nor the parties themselves can – without your consent – alter their joint legal duties under a lease they both signed.  [This situation is not dissimilar to spouses jointly signing their mortgage and then divorcing; they both remain liable under the mortgage, even though one vacates the home.] The best a divorce court can do is to make the occupying ex-spouse primarily responsible for the rent and give indemnity rights to the non-occupying ex-spouse in case she or he end up having to pay for unpaid rent that should have been paid by the occupying ex-spouse.</em></p>
<p>3. Do we rescreen the remaining resident to see if he/she qualifies on their own?</p>
<p><em>I have a visceral reaction to doing so – if they did not pass the credit requirements, then what?  Deny them the right to stay in the community in which they have lived for a number of years?  Kick them out without waiting to see whether they can – or will make the payments?  That is like punishing the remaining ex-spouse for being divorced.  Remember, the occupying ex-spouse will likely be the custodial parent, if children are involved.  The non-custodial parent will likely have some child support obligation, which would then make the custodial parent’s individual credit score less important.   The same may be said even if there are no children; there may be a spousal support obligation by the non-occupying ex-spouse.  It seems to me that it will become clear soon enough, whether the occupying ex-spouse can or will make the space rental payments, independent of what their current credit score may be.</em></p>
<p>4. If we do rescreen the remaining resident and he/she fails the credit or criminal background, what are our options?</p>
<p><em>Before you re-screen, re-read my answer to Question No. 3 above.  If the lease agreement or rules do not address the possibility of spouses divorcing – and I have never seen any that do – the ultimate decision on whether you may re-screen could be left up to a judge.  I submit that judges do not like to evict people out of their homes unless there is a compelling reason to do so.  A case in which a resident is being evicted for no reason other than that they no longer meet the credit criteria – with no evidence that they are in default under the lease or rules – would be a very difficult sell to most judges.  It is unlikely that you would prevail.  I compare this situation to requiring a resident to be re-screened upon a job loss or death of a spouse. In cases of such unplanned events occurring after residents have been approved, I suggest that you let the situation play itself out.  If a resident cannot afford to pay the space rent, you will then have sufficient cause to evict.  But to try to evict because you doubt the ability of the resident to pay rent in the future, is premature and likely to fail. </em></p>
<p><em></em> 5. Who owns the security deposit or pre-paid rent?</p>
<p><em>That depends upon whether you have the remaining resident sign a new lease. If a new lease is signed, you could issue a refund check to both of them under the first least, and require the remaining occupant to pay a new deposit under the new lease.  It would be preferable, however, to see if they could agree to authorize you to leave the existing deposit in place, but permitting you to refund it, if appropriate, to the remaining occupant at the end of his/her tenancy.  If no agreement can be reached, simply hold the deposit until expiration of the tenancy by the occupying non-spouse, and then, if a refund is in order, make the check out to both of them.</em></p>","<p>Question:  A few years ago, a married couple originally applied together for residency in our community.

"33","33","1","The Tenant Application and Screening Process by Phil Querin","<p>Generally  The tenant application process is one of the least understood by landlords and managers.  This lack of familiarity can result in significant liability to park owners.  The purpose of this article is to set forth the applicable laws governing the process, and discuss some tips and traps that may be useful when certain issues and problems arise.</p><p>Screening Criteria The manufactured housing section of Oregon's landlord-tenant law provides that ""Any conditions the landlord applies in approving a purchaser...as a tenant in the event the tenant elects to sell the home"" should be disclosed in the rental or lease agreement.""[1] Although those conditions must be in conformance with state and federal laws, there are no limitations or restrictions as to what may be placed in the rental or lease agreement.</p><p>MHCO's rental and lease agreement forms[2] contain a number of criteria that landlords may impose, such as:  (a) prior rental references; (b) unsatisfactory credit history or no credit history; (c) character references; (d) criminal history; (e) insufficient income to reasonably meet the monthly space rent and other expense obligations imposed by the rental or lease agreement; (f) the presence, number and size of pets; (g) age verification criteria if the park is a 55+ facility; (h) evidence of falsified or misleading material information; (i) refusal to sign a written lease or rental agreement; (j) additional occupants; and (k) adverse public record information.</p><p>Although there may be other criteria that landlords may wish to use when deciding whether to accept an applicant as a tenant, the above list is very comprehensive, and should be sufficient in imposing adequate guidelines when a tenant wishes to sell their home on site.  MHCO additionally has an application form which solicits this and other information from prospective tenants.</p><p>Landlords and managers should become familiar with the criteria imposed in their rental agreements and rental application forms.  Additionally, they should not rely upon the application information submitted to them without a thorough background check that provides the necessary verification.  Although Oregon law imposes a 7-day period within which landlords have to respond to a submitted application, it does not prohibit landlords from imposing a longer period so long as the applicant agrees.  Additionally, Oregon law expressly states that the 7-day period does not commence if the application is incomplete or inaccurate.  Accordingly, landlords and managers would be wise to immediately return any submitted</p><p>application if it is incomplete – and upon discovering that the prospective tenant/purchaser provided inaccurate information, the application should also be returned.  Accepting an incomplete application or continuing with the process after discovering that the applicant has provided bad information can result in an argument by the existing tenant or the new applicant that the landlord is intentionally delaying the process.</p><p>It is also important to note that Oregon law permits the ""...landlord and the prospective purchaser (to) agree to a longer time period for the landlord to evaluate the prospective purchaser's application or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord's screening or admission criteria.""  Thus, as noted on the MHCO Application form, there is a place for the landlord to insert a period longer than the statutory seven day period.  If the landlord suspects any delay, either on the applicant's part or his own part, a longer period should be inserted.  If the applicant rejects this extension, then the landlord can decide whether he wants to proceed to process the application at all.</p><p>Note: If a tenant has not previously given the landlord the 10 days' advance notice of intent to sell as required in ORS 90.680(4) (a), the landlord's seven day response time is extended to 10 days.  But remember, in no instances does the landlord have to receipt and process an inaccurate or incomplete application.  It is better not to accept a defective application – or return it immediately upon finding that it is inaccurate or incomplete, than continuing to process it.</p><p>If a landlord requires a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy at the time that the landlord gives the prospective purchaser the application the landlord shall also give the prospective purchaser copies of the statement of policy, the rental agreement and the facility rules and regulations, including any conditions imposed on a subsequent sale. It is important to remember that the terms of these park document given to the prospective tenant need not be the same as those in the existing (i.e. selling) tenant's documents.[3]</p><p>Park Documents  Landlords and managers should always remember that when they change one of the park documents, they may have to change others. This is because of two risks: (a) The failure to incorporate a change in the lease, say, into the Statement of Policy, and (b) An inconsistency between one or more of the park documents, such as the rental agreement and the rules.  Rules can generally be changed in the middle of a tenancy, but rental agreements cannot.  So landlords should remember to make sure their documents are all internally consistent.</p><p>Fair Housing Laws  The state and federal fair housing laws are essentially – but not completely – the same.  Landlords and managers should familiarize themselves with any special ordinances found in their city or county laws.  However, Oregon law prohibits any form of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing when directed at the following protected classes: ""...race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status or source of income.""[4]  The easiest, best, and safest way to deal with the risk of a discrimination claim is to make all screening criteria facially neutral.  Do not have rules which – even unintentionally - could have a negative impact on a member of a protected class.</p><p>In Oregon, most claims of discrimination relate to familial status.  Examples range from managers encouraging families to purchase and reside in one particular area of the community (where there are more children), to making off-hand comments to applicants (e.g. ""there would be very few children for your kids to play with here"") that may be construed as indicating a desire not to rent to people with children.  For this reason, landlords and managers should strive to apply their screening criteria neutrally regardless of the applicant's membership in a protected class.</p><p>Additionally, caution should be exercised in answering questions over the phone, since federal and state ""testers"" have been known to test parks by making multiple phone calls asking various loaded questions, such as ""Is this a good place to raise my children?""  If the community is a family park, the best response to open-ended telephone inquiries is to tell the caller that it is a family park, open to all, and that they are welcome to come in and pick up an application for processing.</p><p>One of the biggest areas of concern for landlords and managers today involve issues of immigration status.  At the risk of minimizing the problem, there is one basic rule that landlords and managers should always remember when screening applicants.  While it is not a ""silver bullet,"" it should help avoid the vast majority of issues regarding immigration status.  Never treat any single applicant differently from another.  This means that landlords should not automatically ""suspect"" that certain persons are illegally in this country and then impose more rigorous screening criteria on them alone.  It is best not to ask about immigration status.[5]  If the applicant passes the same screening criteria imposed upon others, and all of the information in their application checks out, you should accept the current applicant, regardless of whether you have suspicions about their immigration status. One of the frequently asked questions is whether a landlord may insist that applicants provide their social security number.  While this is not automatically illegal, it can be when applied to some applicants and not others.  Consistency is the name of the game.  Do not request verification in some cases and not others.  Do not accept some tenants who fail to provide the number, but accept others (who are not obviously immigrants) without also providing such proof.</p><p>Another area of concern is occupancy limits or extra occupancy charges.[6]  This is somewhat of a grey area because Oregon law currently permits a two person per bedroom rule – assuming that it is expressly listed as part of the park's screening criteria and uniformly applied.  However, the problem is that federal law contains no specific occupancy limits.  This means that, in theory, one could be in compliance with state law, while violating federal law.  For example, if a family consisted of two adults and three children who owned a 2-bedroom home, a ""2-persons per bedroom"" requirement would mean that they could not move into the park.  But if the third child was an infant who slept in the parents' room, one may ask whether this standard is reasonable, even though it complies with Oregon law.  At the risk of violating federal law, which imposes no such occupancy limits, the better approach might be to avoid the ""slippery slope"" problem entirely, by not creating occupancy limits.[7]</p><p>Perhaps the most difficult of screening criteria issues is in the area of assistance animals.  Since handicap is a protected class, this means that if one could establish a legitimate need for an assistance animal they could not be prevented from having one – even though the park might have a one-pet policy and this might be their second pet.  This could be so even though the animal was not trained or certified in providing assistance.  MHCO has Form 15 that may be given to tenants applying for a ""reasonable accommodation"" which is the technical term used when an allegedly handicapped person requests relief from strict application of a rule that interferes with their handicapped. [8] As most landlords and managers know, the handicap protections can be severely stretched.  There are many reasons for this, including, among other things, the handicap may be allegedly psychological, and the tenant has nothing more than a note from a doctor – not a treating psychologist or psychiatrist.</p><p>The other difficult issue is that assistant animals are not technically ""pets"" and therefore are not subject to the requirement that the Pet Agreement be completed.  Ultimately it comes down to a rule of reason and proof.  Does it appear that the person requesting the accommodation is legitimately handicapped? Do they have a known history of the handicap – that is, has it ever come up before?  Does it appear that the claim of a handicap is new, and possibly raised as a pretext, say to circumvent a one-pet policy?</p><p>Ultimately, the issue comes down to public safety in the community.  For example, if the tenant wanted to have a pit bull (in violation of a dangerous breed prohibition) or a bull-mastiff (in violation of a size restriction), the landlord should ask which battle he or she wants to fight?  If the tenant isn't credible, has a history of skirting the rules on this or other issues, it might make sense to refuse and let them take the next step.  If they bring the animal into the park in light of the denial, you will have a choice; either do nothing or send out a notice of violation which would require removal of the animal.  The risk in allowing dangerous or oversized breed into the park is that it may harm someone, and then the landlord will have to defend a lawsuit for failing to enforce their own rules.  Additionally, in consenting, the precedent has been set, now permitting such animals based upon a tenant's assertion the need it for assistance.  Remember, ""reasonable accommodations"" need only be ""reasonable.""  Dogs with vicious propensities or who pose danger to children because of their size, are not the only type of assistance animals available.</p><p>Marijuana cards raise the same issue, although perhaps even worse, since the cards seem to be freely given to almost anyone.  In some cases, however, this too can be dealt with on another level. If the persons with medical marijuana cards have an inordinate amount of traffic at their home throughout the day and night, perhaps the issue is one for the police, since it is still illegal to sell or distribute marijuana, medical or otherwise.  If they are dealing in the illegal drug, careful (documented) scrutiny of these comings and goings might prove useful.</p><p>Miscellaneous Screening and Application Issues Occasionally, tenants apply for occupancy even though they cannot afford to purchase the home on their own, and perhaps would not qualify under the financial criteria imposed for acceptance into the park.  However, they may have a parent or other person willing to assist in the purchase and willing to guarantee the applicant's performance.  There is nothing wrong with this approach, assuming that the guarantor passes all of the financial criteria the park would impose.  First, remember that the guarantor will not be living in the home – they may have their own housing requirements that impose financial limitations on them.  If the tenant defaults, can the guarantor actually afford to pay the space rent?  Under such cases, the financial criteria applied to co-signers should be more rigorous than those imposed on tenant applicants.  Secondly, landlords should be sure to have their attorney draft a solid guarantee agreement that gives them the right to seek payment against the guarantor without having to first evict the tenant.  Third, before accepting a co-signer, a landlord should ask whether they have a sufficiently significant relationship with the applicant such that they will actually be willing to subsidize the space rent if it is not paid.</p><p>A fundamental problem in the tenant screening process is the denial process.  Landlords must be prompt in informing applicants if their application is denied.  Obviously, a denial can provoke an angry response.  Landlords need to be proactive.  MHCO has two forms to address the issue, so that the landlord or manager does not have to engage in any more explanation than that provided in the form.  MHCO Form 10, identifies the source of the material or information resulting in the turn down.  That is all the landlord is required to do, unless it comes from a credit reporting agency. In that case, MHCO's Form 10A should be given so that applicant has the ability to know which credit company was involved and track down the source of the information.</p><p>It is due to financial issues that many applicants get turned down.  Especially today. For that reason, MHCO has developed the ""Straight Talk"" form, describing manufactured home living and affordability issues.  It should be used in all cases, if possible.</p><p>Although we discussed the Statement of Policy (""SOP"") above, there are two additional points to be made: (a) Always be sure to obtain a receipt (MHCO Form 7C), since it is proof positive that the resident received the SOP and the Rules and Rental or Lease Agreement.  Without the receipt, the tenant can deny receiving it, and the burden of proof to establish delivery is on the landlord.  This can be a difficult task unless witnesses were present who can verify delivery.  (b) The second item to note is use of the Rent History attachment to the SOP a copy of the Rent History (Form 7A).  This permits the tenant to see the monthly base rent for each of the five years preceding the current year of tenancy.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important (and newest) forms if not used, is the Flood Plain Notice (MHCO Form 6).  It notifies those residents whose homes are located in all or part of a 100-year floodplain.  This means that landlords and/or their managers, should look at a current FEMA map to determine whether all or a portion of their park is located inside such a plain.  If so, those residents whose spaces are in the floodplain should be notified.  While technically, being located in a 100-year floodplain means that flood water levels are statistically expected to flood onto the plain once every 100 years, most people realize that over the course of 100 years, there could be three or more such floods or none at all.  The MHCO form, in compliance with Oregon statute, suggests to those receiving the notice that they consider obtaining flood insurance.  The good news is that once having given this notice, a landlord is not liable for any uninsured water loss suffered by the resident due to a flood; the bad news is that failing to give the notice can subject the landlord to the lesser of two months' rent or the resident's actual damages, whichever is less.</p><p>Conclusion  Landlords would have fewer tenant problems if they took more time during the screening process. This means resisting the temptation to fill a space quicker than the approval process actually takes.  Unfortunately, the desire to have the rental flow commence quickly sometimes results in the process becoming rushed.  And landlords and managers should never allow the applicant to rush them.  Nor should they ever permit an applicant to move into a home before the process has been completed and a new rental agreement signed.  Lastly, fairness and uniformity in screening will help to avoid the ever-present liability that can occur under the federal and state Fair Housing laws.</p><p>©Copyright 2010 by Phillip C. Querin.

This creates the appearance that questions regarding immigration status are reserved for Latinos or those from other Central American countries.

Dogs with vicious propensities or who pose danger to children because of their size, are not the only type of assistance animals available.</p><p>Marijuana cards raise the same issue, although perhaps even worse, since the cards seem to be freely given to almost anyone.  In some cases, however, this too can be dealt with on another level. If the persons with medical marijuana cards have an inordinate amount of traffic at their home throughout the day and night, perhaps the issue is one for the police, since it is still illegal to sell or distribute marijuana, medical or otherwise.  If they are dealing in the illegal drug, careful (documented) scrutiny of these comings and goings might prove useful.</p><h2>Miscellaneous Screening and Application Issues</h2><p>Occasionally, tenants apply for occupancy even though they cannot afford to purchase the home on their own, and perhaps would not qualify under the financial criteria imposed for acceptance into the park.  However, they may have a parent or other person willing to assist in the purchase and willing to guarantee the applicant's performance.  There is nothing wrong with this approach, assuming that the guarantor passes all of the financial criteria the park would impose.  First, remember that the guarantor will not be living in the home – they may have their own housing requirements that impose financial limitations on them.  If the tenant defaults, can the guarantor actually afford to pay the space rent?  Under such cases, the financial criteria applied to co-signers should be more rigorous than those imposed on tenant applicants.  Secondly, landlords should be sure to have their attorney draft a solid guarantee agreement that gives them the right to seek payment against the guarantor without having to first evict the tenant.  Third, before accepting a co-signer, a landlord should ask whether they have a sufficiently significant relationship with the applicant such that they will actually be willing to subsidize the space rent if it is not paid.</p><p>A fundamental problem in the tenant screening process is the denial process.  Landlords must be prompt in informing applicants if their application is denied.  Obviously, a denial can provoke an angry response.  Landlords need to be proactive.  MHCO has two forms to address the issue, so that the landlord or manager does not have to engage in any more explanation than that provided in the form.  MHCO Form 10, identifies the source of the material or information resulting in the turn down.  That is all the landlord is required to do, unless it comes from a credit reporting agency. In that case, MHCO's Form 10A should be given so that applicant has the ability to know which credit company was involved and track down the source of the information.</p><p>It is due to financial issues that many applicants get turned down.  Especially today. For that reason, MHCO has developed the ""Straight Talk"" form, describing manufactured home living and affordability issues.  It should be used in all cases, if possible.</p><p>Although we discussed the Statement of Policy (""SOP"") above, there are two additional points to be made: (a) Always be sure to obtain a receipt (MHCO Form 7C), since it is proof positive that the resident received the SOP and the Rules and Rental or Lease Agreement.  Without the receipt, the tenant can deny receiving it, and the burden of proof to establish delivery is on the landlord.  This can be a difficult task unless witnesses were present who can verify delivery.  (b) The second item to note is use of the Rent History attachment to the SOP a copy of the Rent History (Form 7A).  This permits the tenant to see the monthly base rent for each of the five years preceding the current year of tenancy.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important (and newest) forms if not used, is the Flood Plain Notice (MHCO Form 6).  It notifies those residents whose homes are located in all or part of a 100-year floodplain.  This means that landlords and/or their managers, should look at a current FEMA map to determine whether all or a portion of their park is located inside such a plain.  If so, those residents whose spaces are in the floodplain should be notified.  While technically, being located in a 100-year floodplain means that flood water levels are statistically expected to flood onto the plain once every 100 years, most people realize that over the course of 100 years, there could be three or more such floods or none at all.  The MHCO form, in compliance with Oregon statute, suggests to those receiving the notice that they consider obtaining flood insurance.  The good news is that once having given this notice, a landlord is not liable for any uninsured water loss suffered by the resident due to a flood; the bad news is that failing to give the notice can subject the landlord to the lesser of two months' rent or the resident's actual damages, whichever is less.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Landlords would have fewer tenant problems if they took more time during the screening process. This means resisting the temptation to fill a space quicker than the approval process actually takes.  Unfortunately, the desire to have the rental flow commence quickly sometimes results in the process becoming rushed.  And landlords and managers should never allow the applicant to rush them.  Nor should they ever permit an applicant to move into a home before the process has been completed and a new rental agreement signed.  Lastly, fairness and uniformity in screening will help to avoid the ever-present liability that can occur under the federal and state Fair Housing laws.</p><p>©Copyright 2010 by Phillip C. Querin.

"275","275","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Reasonable Accommodation and Caregivers","Question:  A resident wants her son to be her caregiver but lives in a 55 & Older community.  The community’s minimum second person age is 45, and the son is 38.  Can the landlord ask the resident to complete a ""Reasonable Accommodation Form""?  Does the son have to fill out a resident application?  


Answer:  The answer would be the same regardless of whether it is a family park or a 55+ park. This is an issue of making a “reasonable accommodation” under the federal fair housing act.  Handicapped persons are members of a protected class.  Is the resident “handicapped”?  With the various infirmities that can come with older age, there is a likelihood that the resident could qualify as a member of that class.  If so, then the landlord should give the tenant a MHCO Request for Reasonable Accommodation form.  If everything checks out, granting a “reasonable accommodation” to the community’s minimum age requirement for a second person in a senior park from 45 to 38 is probably not unreasonable.  It will not cost the landlord anything.  It will not set a “precedent” since federal law requires such concessions for handicapped.  All in all, it is a fairly easy solution.  

Note that I am not commenting on the validity of the request itself. This accommodation is not costly or risky, so the analysis is fairly simple.  The harder cases are where the resident wants to bring in a pit bull or other breed with a dangerous reputation; as an “assistance animal,” or the assistance provider, while a relative, has a recent criminal record for violence.  If these cases, the landlord has to evaluate the legitimacy of the request, the need to accommodate a “pit bull” or ex-con, versus some other alternative, and the likelihood the resident will contest an outright denial.

In this case, I have no problem with having the son fill out an informational form containing contact information, background information and a criminal check.  However, since he is not applying for residency, his financial qualifications are irrelevant, since he is there to lend assistance, not pay rent.

"316","316","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Abandoned Home with Lots of Deferred Taxes","Question:     We are currently dealing with an abandoned home where the tenant has passed away and he was in a ""Senior Tax Deferral"" program through the Oregon Dept. of Revenue (“DOR”). According to our county tax collector the deceased tenant’s account is current, since the DOR has paid them ever since the tenant entered the program in 1999.  A title search on the home has the DOR listed as a lien holder.  

My question is if and when the abandoned property is sold at a private auction and we (the Landlord) win with the highest sealed bid, are we liable for the taxes in the program?  Are they considered already paid? Is the DOR simply a lien holder or are they considered a tax collector?  Side note: According to the tax collector, this home is valued at approximately $20,000.
 
Answer:   The Department of Revenue (“DOR”) is treated like any other lienholder.  It is critical that before the 45-day letter is sent, the park check with the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services (“DCBS”) to determine if there are any lienholders on title.  We understand that DOR is now showing up on the DCBS records.  Remember, if they show up on the record and you fail to give them notice, they could come back against the park for failing to notify them. 

If they show up on the DCBS records, they should be copied on the 45-day letter, and given all of the same rights as other lienholders, e.g. entering into a one year storage agreement, paying the storage fees, selling the home, etc.  Currently, it is our understanding the DOR does not sign and returned storage agreements.  

If there is a purchase money lien on the property, it will be superior to the DOR and then it [the DOR] will only get payment if there is any equity from the sale.  Since the property is worth more than $8,000, if there is no sale, it would go to auction.  [Caveat: Even if the DOR doesn’t respond to the 45-day letter, they still must be notified of the upcoming auction, per the statute.  Again, there could be liability to the DOR if they have a valid lien, got the 45-day letter, but weren’t informed of the date and time of the auction.] 

As a lienholder, the DOR is behind the park, in terms of payment of cost, and then the county tax collector [which presumably is current – thanks to the DOR].  Next, as a lienholder, the DOR would receive some payment.  If there are any further proceeds, they would go to the tenant, and if the tenant cannot be located, then to the county fund.  

If the landlord follows these procedures, there is no remaining liability to the DOR for and of the taxes paid under the program.

"311","311","3","Phil Querin Q&A Resident Over Pays Rent - How to Account for Late Fees","Question. We had a situation come up recently that we would like your opinion on.  With this particular lease, rent is due on the 1st and a late fee is assessed if not received by midnight of the 5th.  We send 72-hour notices on the 8th of the month at the earliest.  

In this situation, a tenant has purposely over-paid rent on a number of payments in order to build up a credit balance with us.  He has accrued several late fees that have been assessed due to late payments after the 5th of the month - but before a 72 hour notice is ever sent.  We recently deducted the accrued late fees from the credit balance he had built up.  Because there was still a credit balance showing on his account after deducting the late fees, we did not send him any further notices about the late fees being assessed or deducted.  He is now claiming that it was illegal to deduct the late fees from the credit balance without our sending him a notice or invoice.  Your thoughts?

Answer.  It is unclear if there ever was an actual agreement between landlord and tenant that the overpayments were to be applied toward late fees.  For purposes of this question, I will assume there was an understanding of sorts [what tenant intentionally overpays, without a reason?], but presumably not in writing; hence, this dispute.

The lack of any written agreement invites an argument as to how the credits were to be applied.  There is an argument this was “prepaid rent” under ORS 90.100(33) (Definitions). Prepaid rent is a payment for rent not yet due.  Prepaid rent is treated much like a security deposit, and must be accounted for at the end of the tenancy.  See, ORS 90.300 (Security Deposits; Prepaid Rent).  Rent [prepaid or otherwise] cannot be applied to such things as fees or deposits.   See, ORS 100(35) (Definitions).

In this situation, without a written agreement specifically defining what the prepayments were, and how they were to be applied, I would say the tenant may have an argument that without his consent, the money could not be applied to anything except a rent that is already due.  In other words, you may not apply the monies to non-rent charges.

The landlord-tenant statutes don’t specifically address this type of situation, so it’s a toss-up whether the practice was legal or illegal.  [I assume that your rental agreement specifies whether late fees must be assessed in writing. Typically, no writing is required – the fees just become due within a certain period of time.]  In any event, I don’t think this is arrangement is a good practice without having it in writing.   In the future, if both landlord and tenant want to continue the practice, it should be in writing and specifically address: (a) What the payments are; (b) When, how and under what circumstances they may be applied; (c) Whether any prior notice and/or written accounting is necessary; and (d) Whether interest will accrue to the tenant for the monies held by the landlord before they are applied.

"277","277","3","Phil Querin Q&A  What Type of Fines May And May Not Be Levied By A MHC Landlord","Question: A landlord recently issued a fine to a resident for not cleaning up his yard.  The resident claimed that the landlord could not do this.  What does Oregon law say regarding the types of fines a landlord may and may not levy?

Answer: The answer is found in ORS 90.302 (Fees allowed for certain landlord expenses).  What follows is a brief summary:
(1)	A landlord may not charge a fee at the beginning of the tenancy for an anticipated expense (i.e. one that has not actually occurred).
(2)	A landlord may not require the payment of any fee except as provided in this statute.
(3)	The specific fee must be described in a written rental agreement.
(4)	The following list are the fees a landlord may charge:
a.	A late rent payment, pursuant to ORS 90.260.
b.	 A dishonored check, pursuant to ORS 30.701 (5). [Note that the amount of the fee may not exceed the amount described in ORS 30.701 (5) plus any amount that a bank has charged the landlord for processing the dishonored check.] 
c.	Removal or tampering with a properly functioning smoke alarm, smoke detector or carbon monoxide alarm, as provided in ORS 90.325 (2).
d.	 The violation of a written pet agreement or rule relating to pets in a facility, pursuant to ORS 90.530.
e.	The abandonment or relinquishment of a home during a fixed term tenancy without cause. [Note that the fee may not exceed one and one-half times the monthly rent. A landlord may not assess a fee under this section if the abandonment or relinquishment is pursuant to ORS 90.453 (2) (Termination of tenant who is victim of domestic violence), ORS 90.472 (Termination of tenant who is called to active state service) or ORS 90.475. (Termination of tenant sue to service with Armed Forces)]
f.	If the landlord assesses a fee under (e) above:
i.	The landlord may not recover unpaid rent for any period of the fixed term tenancy beyond the date that the landlord knew or reasonably should have known of the abandonment or relinquishment; 
ii.	The landlord may not recover damages related to the cost of renting the dwelling unit to a new tenant; and
iii.	ORS 90.410 (3) (Effect of tenant failure to give notice of absence) does not apply to the abandonment or relinquishment.
(5)	 Noncompliance with written rules or policies. [Note that the fee may not exceed $50.] 
(6)	A fee may be assessed under paragraph (5), above, only for the following types of noncompliance:
a.	The late payment of a utility or service charge that the tenant owes the landlord as described in ORS 90.315.
b.	Failure to clean up pet waste from the tenant’s space other than the home itself.
c.	Failure to clean up garbage, rubbish and other waste from the tenant’s space other than the home itself.
d.	Parking violations. 
e.	The improper use of vehicles within the premises.
(7)	 A landlord is not required to account to a tenant for, or return to, the tenant any fee. 
(8)	Except where the tenant abandons or relinquishes the space during a fixed term tenancy [see (4) e above], a landlord may not charge a tenant any form of liquidated damages, however designated. [Note: A liquidated damage is a pre-fixed amount that doesn’t necessarily relate directly to the actual amount of damages suffered by the landlord] 
(9)	Nonpayment of a fee is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent - but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause. 
(10)	The above laws regarding fines do not apply to:
a.	Attorney fees; 
b.	 Applicant screening charges; or
c.	 Charges for improvements or other actions that are requested by the tenant and are not required of the landlord by the rental agreement or by law.

The resident was extremely intoxicated at the time and made threats and gestures that were very inappropriate and provocative.  There are some residents who want us to immediately issue a 24-hour notice.  However, until this incident, the resident has been a good tenant and never caused a problem.  How should we handle this?  This incident seems entirely out of character for this individual.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The statute governing the issuance of a 24-hour notice is ORS 90.396 [Acts or omissions justifying termination 24 hours after notice.]    Subsection (1)(f) states that a 24-hour notice may be appropriate in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>The tenant, someone in the tenant’s control or the tenant’s pet commits any act that is outrageous in the extreme, on the premises or in the immediate vicinity of the premises. For purposes of this paragraph, an act is outrageous in the extreme if the act is not described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection, but is similar in degree and is one that a reasonable person in that community would consider to be so offensive as to warrant termination of the tenancy within 24 hours, considering the seriousness of the act or the risk to others. An act that is outrageous in the extreme  is more extreme or serious than an act that warrants a 30-day termination under ORS 90.392. [Emphasis mine.]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in close cases, what is “outrageous” is frequently in the eyes of the beholder.  The question is was this truly an isolated incident for which you could give a 30-day notice that he could cure by simply not repeated within the following 30 days?  If he repeated it thereafter [i.e. within 6 months following the date of the 30-day notice] you could terminate with a 20-day, non-curable, notice.</p>
<p>In making a decision whether to do a 24-hour notice, which is non-curable, or a 30-day notice which is, you should consider the following factors:</p>
<p>1.   Has this ever occurred before?</p>
<p>2.   How long has the resident been in the park?</p>
<p>3.   Is there a reason to believe the conduct will be repeated?</p>
<p>4.   Does the resident have a drinking/emotional problem on a regular basis?</p>
<p>5.    Did the conduct pose any immediate threat to health or safety?</p>
<p>6.    Was actual violence involved?</p>
<p>If you genuinely believe that a 30-day notice would work, it will still provide you with the opportunity to issue a 20-day non-curable notice if he fell off the wagon again - either within the 30 days or within 180 days following the date of issuance of the 30 day notice.  Remember that the 24-hour notice is final, whereas the 30-day notice is not, because it can be “cured.”  This may be a case where you should issue the 30-day notice, and make it clear to him that the next time will be final.   In any event, the conduct should not be ignored – a notice should issue.</p>","<p><strong>Question: </strong> We have a resident in the park who recently got into a verbal shouting match with another neighbor.",,"1345070538","2"

Answer:  It’s easy to get confused. There is a lot to remember.  Generally all of the answers are contained in ORS 90.630 [Termination by landlord; causes; notice; cure; repeated nonpayment of rent].  Here is a short summary:

•	The landlord may terminate a rental agreement that is a month-to-month or fixed term tenancy in a manufactured housing community by giving not less than 30 days’ notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination if the tenant:
o	Violates a law or ordinance related to the tenant’s conduct as a tenant, including but not limited to a material noncompliance with ORS 90.740 [Tenant Obligations];
o	Violates a rule or rental agreement provision;
o	Is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587; or
o	Fails to pay a (i) a late charge pursuant to ORS 90.260; (ii) A fee pursuant to ORS 90.302; or (iii) a utility or service charge pursuant to ORS 90.534 or 90.536.
•	The tenant may avoid termination of the tenancy by correcting the violation within the 30-day period specified in notice of violation. However, if substantially the same act or omission recurs within six months after the date of the notice, the landlord may terminate the tenancy upon at least 20 days’ written notice specifying the violation and the date of termination of the tenancy.  In such cases, the tenant does not have a right to correct the violation – and the notice must so state. 
•	Oregon’s “three strikes” law only applies to cases in which the tenant is issued three 72-hour [or 144-hour] notices within a 12-month period.  [Caveat: All three notices must have been validly prepared and delivered or served. – PCQ] The “three strikes” law is found at ORS 90.630(8)-(10). As noted above, multiple violations of the same or similar rule within six months can result in the landlord’s issuance of a non-curable 20-day notice to the tenant.

Sometime later this week the gavel will fall and the 2011 Legislative Session will be history.

Legislators will return in February for a brief session and then on to the 2012 election.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Earlier this month the Senate unanimously passed SB 294 - the landlord-tenant coalition bill. This piece of legislation was the result of 19 meetings each lasting 3 hours held over the past two years. MHCO's President Adam Cook, MHCO Legislative Chair Troy Brost, Dale Strom, Ed Bartholemy and myself attended all the meetings. A great deal of time was spent discussing water sub-metering in manufactured home communities. In 2009 the Oregon Legislature passed a bill that required all communities with more than 199 spaces to sub-meter water.   As a result of that legislation a significant portion of the landlord-tenant coalition was spent working out the problems with the 2009 sub-metering bill. Specially, MHCO set out to prevent the legislature from passing mandatory water sub-metering in every manufactured home community in Oregon. Mandatory water sub-metering for all manufactured home communities in Oregon would have been devastating to many community owners. The coalition bill (SB 294) addresses water sub-metering and clarifies the process community owners are to follow if they <strong><em>VOLUNTARILY</em></strong> decide to sub-mater water in their communities.  <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Maintaining voluntary water sub-metering was a top legislative goal for MHCO and SB 294 accomplished that goal.</span></strong> The bill also addresses the conversion of a manufactured home community to a sub division.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">MHCO attorney, Phil Querin, will provide an analysis and guide to converting to water sub-metering which will be posted at MHCO.ORG later this month.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Overall this was a very good legislative session for owners of manufactured home communities. In January  MHCO set out to defeat several particularly bad pieces of legislation. <strong>HB 2172</strong> and <strong>HB 3183</strong> pertained to rent control in Oregon and both were defeated. An attempt to give the Oregon Attorney General enforcement powers to regulate landlord-tenant law in manufactured home communities was defeated. <strong>SB 85</strong> which would have required all community owners selling a home in their community to establish an escrow account for each home was amended by MHCO and OMHA (Oregon Manufactured Housing Association - Don Miner) to keep this requirement from becoming law. Finally, as mentioned above - MHCO was very concerned that the Legislature would move to make all manufactured home communities sub-meter water. MHCO succeeded in making sure that such a requirement <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">did not pass.</span></strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">There were many other proposals that had hearings but did not move out of committee.

"181","181","3","Phil Querin Q&A Storage Agreement About to Expire Home Unlikely to Sell","Question: A community owner entered into a Storage Agreement on a home in early January 2011.  The agreement provides that the home must be removed by November 30th if it does not sell.  We are now approaching the end of November, and the community owner does not believe the home will be sold by the end of this month.  What’s next?  Does the community owner take the homeowner to court?  Doesn't the landlord have to give one year to the home owner?    

Answer:  There are certain facts that are missing from this question.  I will supply them and then answer.  So, let’s assume the following: (a) This is a periodic (i.e. month-to-month) tenancy; (b) The tenant has moved out of the home and it is now vacant; (c) The rents are not being paid; and lastly, let’s assume that (d) The landlord was to be paid all past-due rent from the sale proceeds.  

However, before answering the question, however, let me point out a fatal error by this landlord – and many other landlords: They don’t look at the Worst Case Scenario.  I’m sure the Storage Agreement adequately covered what was to occur upon sale.  But since we have a landlord now asking what happens if the sale does not occur by November 30, I’m led to believe the parties neglected to address (in writing) the possibility of failure.  Memo to MHCO landlords:  Written agreements with tenants should always address “the exit strategy” – i.e. what protocol kicks in if the home is not sold and not removed by November 30.

Without addressing this issue in the written Storage Agreement, we are left to figure out what Oregon law would provide under these facts.  Here’s my take:

•	On December 1, the landlord should contact the ex-tenant and demand that the home be removed.  This should be done in writing or e-mail, so it can be used later if necessary.

•	If removal does not occur promptly, the landlord must rely upon Oregon law.  Unfortunately, the law leaves landlords holding the bag if a home is abandoned.   

•	The landlord will have to determine if the tenant will voluntarily waive his abandonment rights, and if not, then he must follow the legal procedure under ORS 90.675.  If there is a lienholder on the home, the landlord will have to give them notification under the abandonment law.

•	If the landlord wants to leave the home on the site and resell it to a new tenant, that option is always available , and probably should be pursued first, rather than going down the abandonment route, which can be costly in time and money.  Care should be exercised to properly document such an arrangement, in order to avoid later complaints by the tenant that they were taken advantage of.   

In Oregon, following the formal abandonment process is the only legal way for a landlord to take control of a manufactured home if the tenant fails or refuses to remove it upon termination of the tenancy.

By Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC - MHCO Legal Counsel

1. Generally

1.1 PCQ Observations:

1.1.1 The law recognizes that upon abandonment, there are six primary interests: (1) the tenant, (2) the landlord, (3) the owner (if different from the tenant); (4) the lienholder, if any, (5) the tax collector and (6) the tax assessor. (Note also, that the estate of a deceased tenant/owner residing alone is afforded much of the protections now provided to lienholders.)

1.1.2 What follows is a summary of the abandonment laws. However, this material should not be relied upon in lieu of a thorough review of the law itself and consultation with legal counsel.

2. When abandonment may be declared:

2.1 The tenancy has ended by termination or expiration of the Rental/Lease Agreement, or by surrender or abandonment, and the landlord reasonably believes that the tenant has no intention of asserting any further claim to the premises; or,

2.2 The tenant has been absent from the premises continuously for at least seven (7) days following a court ordered termination that has not been executed upon the by sheriff; or,

2.3 The landlord receives possession of the premises from the sheriff following execution after a Notice of Restitution has been served. See, ORS 105.161

2.4 If the manufactured or floating home is left on the premises, the storage and sale process described in ORS 90.425 (for homes outside of a facility) and 90.675 (for homes inside a facility) must be followed. Any costs incurred by the landlord for execution of the judgment of restitution or for removal, storage or sale of the tenants' property and not recovered pursuant to the public sale provisions of those statutes ""shall be added to the judgment.""

3. Where abandoned personal property and manufactured and floating homes may be stored:

3.1 Subject only to limited exceptions regarding abandoned automobiles or special agreement with the tenant, it must be ""at a place of safekeeping.""

3.2 Manufactured and floating homes must be left upon the rented space.

4. The 45-day advance written notice from landlord to tenant before selling or disposing of abandoned property must be personally served, or sent by first class mail, addressed and mailed to the tenant at the premises, with copies to any post office box and forwarding address actually known by the landlord.

5. If the abandoned property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, a copy of the notice must be sent, via personal delivery or first class mail to:

5.1 Any lienholders actually known to the landlord as well as any lienholders ""of record."" However, the notice must also be sent to any address provided to the landlord in a written notice identifying the home and space that was received from the lienholder within the preceding five (5) years;

5.2 Any owners, if different from the tenant;

5.3 Tax collector of the county where the RV, manufactured home or vehicle is
located; and
5.4 The assessor of the county where the property is located.

6. Contents of the written notice sent to the tenant, lienholder and owner must inform of the following:

6.1 That the personal property is considered abandoned;

6.2 That they must contact the landlord by a specified date to arrange for removal:

6.3 For RVs, manufactured and floating homes, this cannot be less than 45 days after personal delivery or first class mailing of the notice

6.4 The property will be stored in a place of safekeeping, which in the case of an RV, manufactured or floating home shall be the rented space;

6.5 Recipient(s) may arrange for removal by contacting the landlord at a described telephone number or address on or before the specified date;

6.6 Note that if the personal property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, the tenant may not remove it if :(i) the lienholder has foreclosed its lien; (ii) the tenant has waived their rights in writing in a good faith agreement with the landlord not more than 7 days prior to termination of the tenancy; or (iii) the applicable time for the tenant to respond has expired.

6.7 The landlord will make the personal property available for removal by the tenant or any lienholder or owner by appointment at reasonable times.

6.8 The landlord may require payment of storage charges prior to releasing the personal property. (Note: The storage charges shall not exceed the latest monthly space rent last payable by the tenant.)

6.9 If the property is considered abandoned as a result of the execution of a Judgment of Restitution, the landlord shall not require payment of storage charges prior to releasing the property.

6.10 If they fail to contact the landlord within the specified time, or after making contact with the landlord, fail to remove the home within: (a) 30 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes; or (b) 15 days for all other personal property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property. (Note: the 30-day period applies to RVs, and manufactured and floating homes located in or out of a facility.)

6.11 If the landlord reasonably believes the county assessor will determine that the ""current market value"" of the personal property is $8,000 or less, and the landlord intends to dispose of the property if it is not claimed, the notice shall state that belief and intent. (""Current market value"" is defined to mean"" ... the amount in cash, as determined by the county assessor that could reasonably be expected to be paid for (the home) by an informed buyer to an informed seller .... "")

6.12 If applicable, there is a lienholder that has a right to claim the property if otherwise qualified under ORS 90.675;

7. After sending the written notification, the landlord shall store the personal property as follows:

7.1 Manufactured or floating homes: On the rented space or slip, exercising reasonable care;

7.2 All other abandoned personal property, including goods left inside an RV, manufactured or floating home, upon the rented space outside of said home, in a place of safekeeping, exercising reasonable care.

7.2.1 Exceptions for rotting food and abandoned pets or livestock.

7.2.2 May be stored at the dwelling unit, commercial storage or other place of safekeeping.

8. Upon receipt of the written notice, the tenant, lienholder or owner may respond within the 45 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes or the 5 to 8 day period described above for all other personal property. The landlord must make the property available within the next 30 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes and 15 days for all other abandoned personal property.

8.1 If the tenant, lienholder or owner fail to respond, or are late in responding, the personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned and they shall have no further right to the property.

8.2 PCQ Note: This does not mean that they do not have any right to distribution of any sale proceeds. They still do!

8.3 After the property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned, the landlord may:

8.3.1 Destroy or otherwise dispose of the home if the landlord determines from the county assessor that the current market value is $8,000 or less.

8.3.2 Otherwise, the landlord must conduct a public or private sale as follows;

8.3.2.1 If the property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, the
landlord may seek to transfer the certificate of title and registration by complying with the requirements of the Building Codes Division of the Oregon Department of Business and Consumer Services, in the case of manufactured or floating homes, or the State Marine Board, in the case of floating homes.
8.3.2.2 Additionally, if the property is an RV, manufactured or floating
home (and market value is $8,000 or more), the landlord must do the following:
8.3.2.2.1 Advertise the sale in a newspaper of general circulation where the RV or home is located.
8.3.2.2.2 At a reasonable time prior to the sale, give a copy of the newspaper notice to the tenant and any lienholder or owner by personal delivery or first class mail (or in the case of a lienholder, with a certificate of mailing).
8.3.2.2.3 Obtain an Affidavit of Publication from the newspaper showing that the notice ran at least one day for each of two consecutive weeks prior to the date of the sale or the last date bids will be accepted.
8.3.2.2.4 Obtain written proof from the county that all property taxes on the manufactured or floating home have been paid, or if not paid, that the County
has authorized the sale.
9. Conduct of the sale.
9.1 For RVs, manufactured or floating homes, the method, manner, time, place and terms of the sale must be commercially reasonable and conform to the information contained in the landlord's published notice.
9.2 For all other property the sale must be in accordance with ORS 79.5040 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”).
10. Treatment of the proceeds of sale:
10.1 If there is no buyer at the sale, the property is automatically considered to be worth $8,000 or less, regardless of current market value, and the landlord may destroy or otherwise dispose of the personal property.
10.2 The landlord may deduct:
10.2.1 The reasonable or actual cost of notice, storage and sale, and
10.2.2 Unpaid rent.
10.2.3 The remaining proceeds are to be distributed according to the following priorities:
10.2.3.1 County tax collector (manufactured or floating homes only);
10.2.3.2 Any lienholder to the extent of any unpaid balance owned;
10.2.3.3 The balance to the tenant or owner, with an itemized accounting.
10.2.4 If the tenant or owner cannot, after due diligence, be found, the proceeds are to be deposited with the treasurer of the County where the sale occurred, and if not claimed within 3 years they revert to the county.
11. The county tax collector shall cancel all unpaid property taxes if:
11.1 The landlord disposes of the property after the county assessor has determined that the current market value is $8,000 or less;
11.2 There is no buyer at the sale;
11.3 The current market value is $8,000 or less, there is a buyer at the sale, but the proceeds of sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes owed on the home after distribution of the proceeds pursuant to statute (i.e. first to the landlord for actual costs of sale and storage charges, then to the tax assessor and next to the lienholder and last, to the tenant.).
11.4 The landlord buys the property at the sale, the current market value is more than $8,000, the proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the property taxes, and the landlord disposes of the home.

11.5 PCQ Comment: Realistically, landlords who intend to bid at the auction of a home with a tax assessor determined fair market value in excess of $8,000, should plan on paying the unpaid property taxes if they acquire the home at the sale, since those taxes will not be cancelled.

12. If the landlord fails to comply with the abandonment statute, the tenant is relieved of liability for any non-deliberate or non-negligent damage to the premises and for unpaid space rent and the landlord may be held liable for twice the tenant's actual damages.

12.1 Lienholders may recover actual damages from the landlord (but not attorney fees).

12.2 The county tax assessor may recover actual damages (but not attorney fees) in cases of landlord fraud.

13. Special rights of lienholders in manufactured and floating homes:

13.1 Within the 45-day period, the lienholder may request that the landlord enter into written agreement that the dwelling or home not be sold or disposed of for up to 12 months, so long as the lienholder makes timely periodic payment of all storage charges and maintains the dwelling or home and the rented space on which it is stored.

13.2 Lienholders have 60 days to sign and return the storage agreement. The law permits - with specific limitations - the right to include certain utility charges, late charges, and increased the storage charges. The landlord's right to storage fees accrues from the commencement of the 45-day period. Also, if the landlord wants any physical defects repaired, they must be reasonably described in the storage agreement. There are other limitations if the home was placed on the space within the previous 24 months. The repairs must be completed within 90 days and if not, the agreement may be terminated with 14 days' written notice.)

13.3 During the storage agreement period, the lienholder has the right to remove the property, but now must give not less than 14 days advance written notice. All storage charges must be paid before such removal.

13.5 The lienholder may sell the manufactured dwelling or floating home on site, subject to any terms previously agreed upon between the landlord and tenant, or if no agreement, any reasonable conditions imposed by the landlord. In the case of manufactured or floating homes located within facilities, ORS 90.680 applies, which permits landlords to apply their existing tenant screening criteria.

13.6 If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate it upon 90 days' written notice, during which time the lienholder may cure the default. If the default pertains to the nonpayment of a storage charge and the lienholder cures, but defaults a second time, the cure period is reduced to 30 days. If the lienholder fails to timely cure, the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling without further notice to the lien holder.

13.7 Upon termination of the storage agreement, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, or the lienholder has sold or removed the home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice. (Note: This does not mean that the landlord must go through the entire notice procedure again; the sale procedures must be followed if the market value is above $8,000.)

14. If the personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession such as an heir or devisee, timely requests within the 45-day period, they may enter into a written agreement with the landlord that the home not be sold or disposed of for up to 90 days or the conclusion of probate, whichever is longer, so long as storage charges are paid and the space is maintained. If the landlord knows the identity of any personal representative or designated person, a copy of the 45-day letter should be sent to them. (The original 45-day letter should be addressed in the name of the personal representative or designated person and mailed to the premises in the community. Don’t address the notice in the name of the deceased tenant!)

15. A landlord shall not, as a condition of approving an on-site sale, require a tenant or lienholder to waive any rights created under the abandonment law.

16. Homes posing extreme health or safety hazards. (The specifics of the statute should be closely reviewed.)

16.1 If a governmental agency declares a home an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law there is an expedited mailing and removal process.

16.2 The 45-day letter has been reduced to 15 days.

16.3 The response/removal time is 7 days.

16.4 There is no lienholder right to enter into a storage agreement.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>CAVEAT:  THE FOLLOWING IS INTENDED AS GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY, AND NOT AS LEGAL ADVICE. EVERY  PERSON’S INDIVIDUAL FACTUAL SITUATION IS DIFFERENT, AND THE INFORMATION BELOW SHOULD NOT BE RELIED  UPON TO THE EXCLUSION OF A MORE IN-DEPTH EVALUATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAW.  READERS ARE  ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THEIR OWN ATTORNEY OR OTHER EXPERT IN THIS SPECIALIZED AREA.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>1. What is SAFE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SAFE is the acronym for The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008.   Although it is federal legislation that was enacted in response to the national credit and  mortgage crises, it requires each state to enact regulatory legislation. HUD monitors  compliance, although it does not have legal authority to grant exemptions.  On August 30,  2011, HUD published its Final Rule for SAFE.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">HUD is responsible for setting minimum standards for states to following in the licensing of  providers of certain residential mortgage services.  It also has set up the Nationwide Mortgage  Licensing System and Registry (“NMLSR”), which is a national database of all mortgage  companies and mortgage loan originators. Responsibility for oversight falls under the  authority of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank  Act.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>2. What is the purpose of the SAFE Act?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SAFE was designed to increase consumer protection in residential lending.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>3. What activities does SAFE apply to?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It applies to mortgage companies and their mortgage loan originators or “MLOs” acting either  as employees or independent contractors.   An individual is in the business of loan origination  if they, “in a commercial context and habitually or repeatedly” engage in: (1) taking a  residential mortgage loan application; and (2) offering or negotiating the terms of a  residential mortgage loan for compensation or gain; or represent to the public (e.g. through  advertising or other means of communicating) that they will perform these two activities.    The phrase “taking a residential mortgage loan application” means that the MLO receives it  for the purpose of facilitating a credit decision.  The phrase “offering or negotiating” means  that the MLO presents particular lending terms for consideration by a borrower.  It is the  activity - not its label or the title of the person - that determines whether one is a mortgage  loan originator.  The law does not make one a mortgage loan originator if they engage in the  above-described conduct exclusively for public, charitable, or family purposes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In order to obtain a license as an MLO, SAFE requires testing, pre-licensure and continuing  education, criminal background checks and financial responsibility.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>4. What type of transactions does SAFE apply to?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SAFE applies to certain mortgage transactions. A “mortgage transaction” means a credit or  loan transaction that is or will be used by the debtor primarily for personal, family, or  household purposes <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>and</strong></span> is secured by a mortgage or equivalent consensual security interest  on a dwelling or residential real estate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5. Does SAFE apply to the financing of manufactured homes and manufactured  vehicles?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes.  The term ""dwelling"" is cross-referenced to the definition of “dwelling” in section 103(v)  of the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) (15 U.S.C. 1601 note).  Regulation Z, which implements  TILA, defines “dwelling” to mean ""a residential structure that contains 1 to 4 units, whether or  not that structure is attached to real property. Besides attached homes, a dwelling also  includes an individual condominium unit, cooperative unit, mobile home, and trailer, if it is  used as a residence.""  HUD interprets a ""mobile home"" to include a manufactured home, as  defined in the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As to loans secured by manufactured homes treated as personal property under state law  HUD’s final rule states:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>…an individual engaging in the business of a loan originator with respect to a loan  that is to be secured by a manufactured home, mobile home, recreational vehicle, <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>house boat, or trailer that is to be used as a residence is subject to licensing under the  SAFE Act.  Even if a state categorizes loans secured by such residential structures <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>as  chattel mortgages, the SAFE Act covers these loans and such states must ensure that  individuals engaging in the business of a loan originator with respect to these <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>loans  are licensed under the SAFE Act.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>6. Does SAFE apply to sellers of manufactured homes if they don’t directly “lend”  purchase money funds, but merely carry back <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>paper, such as a retail installment contract or  note and security interest in the home?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes.  This was specifically addressed in HUD’s Final Rule:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>A ‘‘residential mortgage loan’’ includes an installment sales contract, which the  commenters advise is frequently involved in seller financing. ‘‘Residential mortgage <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>loans,’’ as defined by section 1503(8) of the SAFE Act, refer to typical financing  mechanisms such as mortgages and deeds of trusts.  In addition, the SAFE Act  definition <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>also includes ‘‘other equivalent consensual security interest on a dwelling  (as the term ‘dwelling’ is defined by section 103(v) of TILA) or residential real estate  upon which <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>is constructed or intended to be constructed a dwelling,’’ which has the  potential for including a broad range of other financing mechanisms.  For the  purposes of this rule, <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>‘‘equivalent consensual security interests’’ specifically include  installment sales contracts, consistent with the treatment by many states of such  contracts in the same <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>manner as mortgages and purchase money mortgages offered  by sellers of residential real estate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>7. Who regulates Oregon’s statewide version of SAFE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Oregon’s version of SAFE is found at ORS Chapter 86A.    It is known as the “Oregon Mortgage  Lender Law.”  The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (“DCBS”)  has general supervision and control over all loan originators, mortgage bankers and mortgage  brokers residing in Oregon or doing business in Oregon - even though they do not reside here.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>8. Under Oregon law, who qualifies as a mortgage loan originator, mortgage banker  and mortgage broker?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <strong>loan originator</strong> is defined under Oregon law to mean an individual employed by or acting as  an agent or independent contractor for a mortgage banker or mortgage broker with the  expectation of compensation or gain that is determined by the amount borrowed or the  terms and conditions agreed to by the mortgage loan borrower.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <strong>loan originator</strong> is the individual having the primary job responsibilities, including  negotiating with a potential borrower for the purpose of establishing the terms and  conditions of a mortgage loan.  A loan originator does not include an individual whose  responsibilities are clerical or administrative, such as gathering information, requesting  information, word processing, soliciting general interest in mortgage loans, sending  correspondence and assembling files.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Subject to several exceptions, a <strong>mortgage banker</strong> is one who for compensation or in the  expectation of compensation, directly or indirectly makes, negotiates or offers to make or  negotiate, a mortgage banking loan or a mortgage loan, and services or sells a mortgage  banking loan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The term does not include financial institutions, financial holding companies, bank holding  companies, savings and loan holding companies as defined under state and federal laws. It  also excludes various individuals who make loans secured by an interest in real estate for the  person’s own investment and who is not engaged in the business of making such loans;  Oregon licensed attorneys; real property owners who sell their own property; builders and  contractors who accept repayment on an installment or deferred payment basis and arising  out of labor and materials furnished in the improvement of that real property, and those who  are exercising their statutory lien rights.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <strong>mortgage broker</strong> is one who engages all or part of the time, for the account of others, or for  the person’s own account, in the business of: (1) Selling real estate paper whether as an  issuer, agent or principal; (2) Accepting funds from one or more persons or (3) For  compensation, or the expectation of compensation, directly or indirectly makes, negotiates or  offers to make or negotiate a mortgage loan.     The exemptions found for mortgage bankers, described above, generally exist for mortgage  brokers, and include real estate licensees, if such services are incidental to their professional  real estate activity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>9. If I have a manufactured dealer’s license would I still be subject to SAFE?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It appears so. Here is what HUD’s Final Rule and Oregon’s statute provide:    A person with a manufactured structure dealer’s license who provides services  customarily associated with the retail sales of manufactured dwellings (including  communication of generally available information regarding mortgage loans) is  excluded from being a mortgage broker, unless:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(1) The person receives from a purchaser a fee or commission as a mortgage  broker or mortgage banker that is disclosed in the sales contract, purchase agreement  or <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>applicable federal documents;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(2) For the benefit of a potential purchaser, the person completes a loan  application form or other document that is part of a mortgage banking loan and  completes a good <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>faith estimate under the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures  Act (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(3) The person solicits or receives credit information from a prospective  purchaser for the purpose of making credit decisions (Underscore added.); or</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>(4) The person negotiates with a potential purchaser the terms of a mortgage  loan including but not limited to points, interest rates, length of loan or other loan  conditions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is this underscored language above that appears to bring you under SAFE, and by  extension, the Oregon law.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>10. Do Mortgage Bankers and Mortgage Brokers have to be licensed in Oregon?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes.  ORS 86A.103  provides that “…it is unlawful for any person to engage in residential  mortgage transactions in this state as a mortgage banker or mortgage broker unless the  person is licensed….”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>11. How does one apply for a Mortgage Banker or Mortgage Broker license?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The law can be found at ORS 86A.106 and rules prescribed by the Director of the Department  of Consumer and Business Services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>12. What does Oregon law provide regarding Mortgage Loan Originators?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Following is a brief summary:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• The names of all mortgage loan originators (“MLOs”) employed by mortgage bankers  or brokers must be provided to the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services  (“DCBS”) and kept at least 30 days’ current.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Mortgage bankers and brokers are required to provide the DCBS with satisfactory  evidence (as determined by administrative rule) that each of the people they have hired or  intend to hire have: (1) Successfully completed an entry-level training course approved or  provided by an organization certified by the DCBS director; and (2) Passed an examination.  If  the individual has been employed as a loan originator for two or more years in this state, they  must have completed the required continuing education.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Mortgage loan originators (as well as mortgage bankers and brokers) may not engage  in dishonest, fraudulent or illegal practices or conduct in a business or profession or engage in  unfair or unethical practices or conduct in connection with the mortgage business; Willfully or  repeatedly violate or fail to comply with a provision of the regulatory laws; Fail to account for  money or property received in connection with a mortgage loan; Fail to meet the training,  education or continuing education requirements for mortgage loan originators; Perform an  act as a mortgage loan originator in a negligent or incompetent manner.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>13. What is the cost of licensing/registering with the DCBS?</strong> Here are the latest administrative rules:     Mortgage Bankers or Brokers   In addition to any fees required to participate in the National Mortgage Licensing  System and Registry, a mortgage banker or a mortgage broker shall pay to the  director the following fees at the time of application or renewal:   (1) A nonrefundable application fee for a mortgage banker or mortgage broker  license of $960 plus a $330 nonrefundable application fee for each branch the  mortgage banker or mortgage broker establishes in Oregon.   (2) A nonrefundable renewal application fee for a mortgage banker or mortgage  broker license of $480 plus a $165 nonrefundable renewal application fee for each  branch the mortgage banker or mortgage broker maintains in Oregon.     Mortgage Loan Originators   (1) In addition to any fees required to participate in the National Mortgage  Licensing System and Registry, a person applying for a mortgage loan originator  license shall pay to the director a nonrefundable fee of $80 for the issuance of a  mortgage loan originator license.   (2) In addition to any fees required to participate in the National Mortgage  Licensing System and Registry, a person renewing a mortgage loan originator license  shall pay to the director a nonrefundable fee of $65 for the renewal of a mortgage  loan originator license.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>14. What are the penalties if I fail to comply?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to ORS 86A.130, whenever the Director of the DCBS has “reasonable cause to believe”  that a person has been engaged or is engaging in any violation of Oregon law (including acting as a  mortgage broker, banker or loan originator without a license), the director may bring suit against  the alleged perpetrator.  The court may fine the person not more than $5,000 for each violation.    Each violation is a separate offense. In the case of a continuing violation, each day’s continuance is  a separate violation, but the maximum penalty for any continuing violation is $20,000 for each  offense.  The court may also appoint a receiver (who can be the Director of the DCBS over the  defendant’s assets).  Additionally, the statute allows for attorney fees.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The director may include a claim for restitution or damages on behalf “of the persons  injured” by the unlawful act or practice.  Additionally, the director may bring a claim for  “disgorgement of illegal gains or profits derived.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>15. What are my choices if I am an Oregon park owner and want to rehab and sell  abandoned or pre-abandoned manufactured homes to prospective buyers who will occupy them?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It appears that you have two choices:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(1) Hire as an employee or independent contractor a MLO who will engage in the activities  described for them under state law.  This will require you to become either a mortgage banker  or mortgage broker.  The reason for this is because the MLO is required to work under the  supervision and control of one or the other.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(2) Contract with an existing MLO who is already working for an Oregon licensed mortgage banker  or broker.  Presumably, this would be on an independent contractor basis.       NOTE:  THE ABOVE INFORMATION WILL BE UPDATED AND CLARIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME.

In other words, now that MLO has complied with the SAFE Act, can this receivable be returned to the community owner to collect the monthly payments?

It could pose a real financial hardship on community owners if they had to pay a third party for servicing that they can do themselves.

1. 	Generally 

	1.1 	PCQ Observations:

1.1.1 	The law recognizes that upon abandonment, there are six primary interests: (1) the tenant, (2) the landlord, (3) the owner (if different from the tenant); (4) the lienholder, if any, (5) the tax collector and (6) the tax assessor. (Note also, that the estate of a deceased tenant/owner residing alone is afforded much of the protections now provided to lienholders.) 

1.1.2 	What follows is a summary of the abandonment laws.  However, this material should not be relied upon in lieu of a thorough review of the law itself and consultation with legal counsel.

2. 	When abandonment may be declared:

2.1 	The tenancy has ended by termination or expiration of the Rental/Lease Agreement, or by surrender or abandonment, and the landlord reasonably believes that the tenant has no intention of asserting any further claim to the premises; or,

2.2 	The tenant has been absent from the premises continuously for at least seven (7) days following a court ordered termination that has not been executed upon the by sheriff; or,

2.3 	The landlord receives possession of the premises from the sheriff following execution after a Notice of Restitution has been served.  See, ORS 105.161

2.4 	If the manufactured or floating home is left on the premises, the storage and sale process described in ORS 90.425 (for homes outside of a facility) and 90.675 (for homes inside a facility) must be followed. Any costs incurred by the landlord for execution of the judgment of restitution or for removal, storage or sale of the tenants' property and not recovered pursuant to the public sale provisions of those statutes ""shall be added to the judgment."" 

3. 	Where abandoned personal property and manufactured and floating homes may be stored: 

3.1 	Subject only to limited exceptions regarding abandoned automobiles or special agreement with the tenant, it must be ""at a place of safekeeping."" 

3.2 	Manufactured and floating homes must be left upon the rented space. 

4. 	The 45-day advance written notice from landlord to tenant before selling or disposing of abandoned property must be personally served, or sent by first class mail, addressed and mailed to the tenant at the premises, with copies to any post office box and forwarding address actually known by the landlord. 

5. 	If the abandoned property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, a copy of the notice must be sent, via personal delivery or first class mail to: 

5.1 	Any lienholders actually known to the landlord as well as any lienholders ""of record."" However, the notice must also be sent to any address provided to the landlord in a written notice identifying the home and space that was received from the lienholder within the preceding five (5) years; 

5.2 	Any owners, if different from the tenant;

5.3 	Tax collector of the county where the RV, manufactured home or vehicle is 
located; and 

5.4 	The assessor of the county where the property is located. 

6. 	Contents of the written notice sent to the tenant, lienholder and owner must inform of the following: 

6.1 	That the personal property is considered abandoned; 

6.2 	That they must contact the landlord by a specified date to arrange for removal: 

6.3 	For RVs, manufactured and floating homes, this cannot be less than 45 days after personal delivery or first class mailing of the notice 

6.4 	The property will be stored in a place of safekeeping, which in the case of an RV, manufactured or floating home shall be the rented space; 

6.5 	Recipient(s) may arrange for removal by contacting the landlord at a described telephone number or address on or before the specified date; 


6.6 	Note that if the personal property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, the tenant may not remove it if :(i) the lienholder has foreclosed its lien; (ii) the tenant has waived their rights in writing in a good faith agreement with the landlord not more than 7 days prior to termination of the tenancy; or (iii) the applicable time for the tenant to respond has expired. 

6.7 	The landlord will make the personal property available for removal by the tenant or any lienholder or owner by appointment at reasonable times. 

6.8 	The landlord may require payment of storage charges prior to releasing the personal property. (Note: The storage charges shall not exceed the latest monthly space rent last payable by the tenant.) 

6.9 	If the property is considered abandoned as a result of the execution of a Judgment of Restitution, the landlord shall not require payment of storage charges prior to releasing the property. 

6.10 	If they fail to contact the landlord within the specified time, or after making contact with the landlord, fail to remove the home within: (a) 30 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes; or (b) 15 days for all other personal property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property. (Note: the 30-day period applies to RVs, and manufactured and floating homes located in or out of a facility.) 

6.11 	If the landlord reasonably believes the county assessor will determine that the ""current market value"" of the personal property is $8,000 or less, and the landlord intends to dispose of the property if it is not claimed, the notice shall state that belief and intent. (""Current market value"" is defined to mean"" ... the amount in cash, as determined by the county assessor that could reasonably be expected to be paid for (the home) by an informed buyer to an informed seller .... "") 

6.12 	If applicable, there is a lienholder that has a right to claim the property if otherwise qualified under ORS 90.675; 

7. 	After sending the written notification, the landlord shall store the personal property as follows: 

7.1 	Manufactured or floating homes: On the rented space or slip, exercising reasonable care; 

7.2 	All other abandoned personal property, including goods left inside an RV, manufactured or floating home, upon the rented space outside of said home, in a place of safekeeping, exercising reasonable care. 

7.2.1 	Exceptions for rotting food and abandoned pets or livestock.

The landlord must make the property available within the next 30 days for RVs, manufactured or floating homes and 15 days for all other abandoned personal property. 

8.1 	If the tenant, lienholder or owner fail to respond, or are late in responding, the personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned and they shall have no further right to the property. 

8.2 	PCQ Note: This does not mean that they do not have any right to distribution of any sale proceeds. They still do! 

8.3 	After the property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned, the landlord may: 

8.3.1 	Destroy or otherwise dispose of the home if the landlord determines from the county assessor that the current market value is $8,000 or less. 

8.3.2 	Otherwise, the landlord must conduct a public or private sale as follows; 

8.3.2.1 	If the property is an RV, manufactured or floating home, the 
landlord may seek to transfer the certificate of title and registration by complying with the requirements of the Building Codes Division of the Oregon Department of Business and Consumer Services, in the case of manufactured or floating homes, or the State Marine Board, in the case of floating homes. 

8.3.2.2 	Additionally, if the property is an RV, manufactured or floating 
home (and market value is $8,000 or more), the landlord must do the following:
 
8.3.2.2.1 	Advertise the sale in a newspaper of general circulation where the RV or home is located. 

8.3.2.2.2 	At a reasonable time prior to the sale, give a copy of the newspaper notice to the tenant and any lienholder or owner by personal delivery or first class mail (or in the case of a lienholder, with a certificate of mailing). 

8.3.2.2.3 	Obtain an Affidavit of Publication from the newspaper showing that the notice ran at least one day for each of two consecutive weeks prior to the date of the sale or the last date bids will be accepted. 

8.3.2.2.4 	Obtain written proof from the county that all property taxes on the manufactured or floating home have been paid, or if not paid, that the County 
has authorized the sale. 

9. 	Conduct of the sale. 

9.1 	For RVs, manufactured or floating homes, the method, manner, time, place and terms of the sale must be commercially reasonable and conform to the information contained in the landlord's published notice. 

9.2 	For all other property the sale must be in accordance with ORS 79.5040 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”). 

10. 	Treatment of the proceeds of sale: 

10.1 	If there is no buyer at the sale, the property is automatically considered to be worth $8,000 or less, regardless of current market value, and the landlord may destroy or otherwise dispose of the personal property. 

10.2 	The landlord may deduct: 

10.2.1 	The reasonable or actual cost of notice, storage and sale, and 

10.2.2 	Unpaid rent. 

10.2.3 	The remaining proceeds are to be distributed according to the following priorities:

10.2.3.1 	County tax collector (manufactured or floating homes only); 

10.2.3.2 	Any lienholder to the extent of any unpaid balance owned; 

10.2.3.3   The balance to the tenant or owner, with an itemized accounting. 

10.2.4 	If the tenant or owner cannot, after due diligence, be found, the proceeds are to be deposited with the treasurer of the County where the sale occurred, and if not claimed within 3 years they revert to the county. 

11. 	The county tax collector shall cancel all unpaid property taxes if: 

11.1 	The landlord disposes of the property after the county assessor has determined that the current market value is $8,000 or less; 

11.2 There is no buyer at the sale;

11.3 	The current market value is $8,000 or less, there is a buyer at the sale, but the proceeds of sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes owed on the home after distribution of the proceeds pursuant to statute (i.e. first to the landlord for actual costs of sale and storage charges, then to the tax assessor and next to the lienholder and last, to the tenant.). 

11.4 	The landlord buys the property at the sale, the current market value is more than $8,000, the proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the property taxes, and the landlord disposes of the home.
11.5 	PCQ Comment: Realistically, landlords who intend to bid at the auction of a home with a tax assessor determined fair market value in excess of $8,000, should plan on paying the unpaid property taxes if they acquire the home at the sale, since those taxes will not be cancelled. 

12. 	If the landlord fails to comply with the abandonment statute, the tenant is relieved of liability for any non-deliberate or non-negligent damage to the premises and for unpaid space rent and the landlord may be held liable for twice the tenant's actual damages. 

12.1 	Lienholders may recover actual damages from the landlord (but not attorney fees). 

12.2 	The county tax assessor may recover actual damages (but not attorney fees) in cases of landlord fraud. 

13. 	Special rights of lienholders in manufactured and floating homes:

13.1 	Within the 45-day period, the lienholder may request that the landlord enter into written agreement that the dwelling or home not be sold or disposed of for up to 12 months, so long as the lienholder makes timely periodic payment of all storage charges and maintains the dwelling or home and the rented space on which it is stored. 

13.2 	Lienholders have 60 days to sign and return the storage agreement. The law permits - with specific limitations - the right to include certain utility charges, late charges, and increased the storage charges. The landlord's right to storage fees accrues from the commencement of the 45-day period. Also, if the landlord wants any physical defects repaired, they must be reasonably described in the storage agreement. There are other limitations if the home was placed on the space within the previous 24 months. The repairs must be completed within 90 days and if not, the agreement may be terminated with 14 days' written notice.) 

13.3 	During the storage agreement period, the lienholder has the right to remove the property, but now must give not less than 14 days advance written notice. All storage charges must be paid before such removal. 

13.5 	The lienholder may sell the manufactured dwelling or floating home on site, subject to any terms previously agreed upon between the landlord and tenant, or if no agreement, any reasonable conditions imposed by the landlord. In the case of manufactured or floating homes located within facilities, ORS 90.680 applies, which permits landlords to apply their existing tenant screening criteria. 

13.6 	If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate it upon 90 days' written notice, during which time the lienholder may cure the default. If the default pertains to the nonpayment of a storage charge and the lienholder cures, but defaults a second time, the cure period is reduced to 30 days. If the lienholder fails to timely cure, the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling without further notice to the lienholder. 

13.7 	Upon termination of the storage agreement, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, or the lienholder has sold or removed the home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice. (Note: This does not mean that the landlord must go through the entire notice procedure again; the sale procedures must be followed if the market value is above $8,000.) 

14. 	If the personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession such as an heir or devisee, timely requests within the 45-day period, they may enter into a written agreement with the landlord that the home not be sold or disposed of for up to 90 days or the conclusion of probate, whichever is longer, so long as storage charges are paid and the space is maintained. If the landlord knows the identity of any personal representative or designated person, a copy of the 45-day letter should be sent to them. (The original 45-day letter should be addressed in the name of the personal representative or designated person and mailed to the premises in the community. Don’t address the notice in the name of the deceased tenant!) 

15. 	A landlord shall not, as a condition of approving an on-site sale, require a tenant or lienholder to waive any rights created under the abandonment law. 

16. 	Homes posing extreme health or safety hazards. (The specifics of the statute should be closely reviewed.) 

16.1 	If a governmental agency declares a home an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law there is an expedited mailing and removal process. 

16.2 The 45-day letter has been reduced to 15 days. 

16.3 The response/removal time is 7 days. 

16.4 There is no lienholder right to enter into a storage agreement.

11.3 	The current market value is $8,000 or less, there is a buyer at the sale, but the proceeds of sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes owed on the home after distribution of the proceeds pursuant to statute (i.e. first to the landlord for actual costs of sale and storage charges, then to the tax assessor and next to the lienholder and last, to the tenant.). 

11.4 	The landlord buys the property at the sale, the current market value is more than $8,000, the proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the property taxes, and the landlord disposes of the home.
11.5 	PCQ Comment: Realistically, landlords who intend to bid at the auction of a home with a tax assessor determined fair market value in excess of $8,000, should plan on paying the unpaid property taxes if they acquire the home at the sale, since those taxes will not be cancelled. 

12. 	If the landlord fails to comply with the abandonment statute, the tenant is relieved of liability for any non-deliberate or non-negligent damage to the premises and for unpaid space rent and the landlord may be held liable for twice the tenant's actual damages.

12.2 	The county tax assessor may recover actual damages (but not attorney fees) in cases of landlord fraud.

13.1 	Within the 45-day period, the lienholder may request that the landlord enter into written agreement that the dwelling or home not be sold or disposed of for up to 12 months, so long as the lienholder makes timely periodic payment of all storage charges and maintains the dwelling or home and the rented space on which it is stored. 

13.2 	Lienholders have 60 days to sign and return the storage agreement. The law permits - with specific limitations - the right to include certain utility charges, late charges, and increased the storage charges. The landlord's right to storage fees accrues from the commencement of the 45-day period. Also, if the landlord wants any physical defects repaired, they must be reasonably described in the storage agreement. There are other limitations if the home was placed on the space within the previous 24 months. The repairs must be completed within 90 days and if not, the agreement may be terminated with 14 days' written notice.) 

13.3 	During the storage agreement period, the lienholder has the right to remove the property, but now must give not less than 14 days advance written notice. All storage charges must be paid before such removal. 

13.5 	The lienholder may sell the manufactured dwelling or floating home on site, subject to any terms previously agreed upon between the landlord and tenant, or if no agreement, any reasonable conditions imposed by the landlord. In the case of manufactured or floating homes located within facilities, ORS 90.680 applies, which permits landlords to apply their existing tenant screening criteria. 

13.6 	If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate it upon 90 days' written notice, during which time the lienholder may cure the default. If the default pertains to the nonpayment of a storage charge and the lienholder cures, but defaults a second time, the cure period is reduced to 30 days. If the lienholder fails to timely cure, the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling without further notice to the lienholder. 

13.7 	Upon termination of the storage agreement, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, or the lienholder has sold or removed the home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice. (Note: This does not mean that the landlord must go through the entire notice procedure again; the sale procedures must be followed if the market value is above $8,000.) 

14. 	If the personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession such as an heir or devisee, timely requests within the 45-day period, they may enter into a written agreement with the landlord that the home not be sold or disposed of for up to 90 days or the conclusion of probate, whichever is longer, so long as storage charges are paid and the space is maintained. If the landlord knows the identity of any personal representative or designated person, a copy of the 45-day letter should be sent to them. (The original 45-day letter should be addressed in the name of the personal representative or designated person and mailed to the premises in the community. Don’t address the notice in the name of the deceased tenant!) 

15. 	A landlord shall not, as a condition of approving an on-site sale, require a tenant or lienholder to waive any rights created under the abandonment law. 

16. 	Homes posing extreme health or safety hazards. (The specifics of the statute should be closely reviewed.) 

16.1 	If a governmental agency declares a home an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law there is an expedited mailing and removal process. 

16.2 The 45-day letter has been reduced to 15 days. 

16.3 The response/removal time is 7 days. 

16.4 There is no lienholder right to enter into a storage agreement.

Currently, Oregon law provides that upon receipt of a copy of the abandonment letter that is sent to a tenant, the lienholder has 45 days to contact the landlord to make arrangements for storage and resale of the home. If the lienholder signs a storage agreement with the landlord, it may then market the home for resale for up to 12 months. If the lienholder fails to make the necessary contact within the 4S-days and sign the storage agreement, the law “conclusively presumes” that the lien has been abandoned. The same conclusive presumption applies to the tenant following expiration of the 45-day period after the landlord’s mailing of the abandonment letter. 

Many landlords erroneously believe that following a tenant's abandonment they can forgo the necessity of the 45-day letter and simply contact the lienholder to make arrangements for payment of the monthly storage fees. Sometimes lienholders cooperate with this informal process, and sometimes they don't. Cooperation usually takes one of two forms: (a) The lienholder signs a ""storage agreement"" and commences making the monthly payments; or, (b) The lienholder signs nothing, but makes the monthly payments anyway. Both of these alternatives are incorrect and could place the landlord in legal jeopardy.   Sending of the 45-day letter is an essential element of commencing the abandonment process legally.

By not sending the 45-day day letter to the tenant and all of the other parties required by law, the abandonment is not legally ""triggered."" Since Oregon law is quite clear that a tenant's abandoned manufactured home may only be disposed of pursuant to the procedures set forth in ORS 90.675, the use of ""shortcuts"" creates a risk on several fronts. First, even though the lienholder may make the payments, the 45-days has not legally commenced, since the triggering event never occurred. Secondly, without sending the 45-day letter to the tenant - even if though they truly abandoned the property - the tenant has never been legally notified of the landlord's intention. 

Additionally, there is always the risk that someone other than the tenant is the record owner of the home. This can only be determined by a check with the Division of Finance and Corporate Securities (“DFCS”). Thus dealing with the lienholder directly, and ignoring the rights of the tenant and perhaps the real owner of the home, means that their rights will not have been legally divested once the home is resold by the lienholder. 

This same problem holds true for other lienholders who may appear on the DFCS records. By dealing with one lienholder, but not notifying the other, the rights of the ignored lienholder have not been divested.  In other words, by not following the abandonment statute to the letter, and failing to give the 45 day letter to all of the people and entities required by the statute, the landlord is at risk that an ignored party will later appear to re-claim either their property or assert their lien rights. 

Substantially the same issue exists when the 45-day letter is not sent to the tax collector or tax assessor. However, since title to the home cannot be transferred without a Form 113 verifying that the taxes have either been paid or waived, this problem usually appears before the home is sold to someone else. 

Thus, if the abandonment is not legally commenced, those who have a right to notification, but do not receive it, have a claim against the landlord.  Here is one doomsday scenario: 

•	Tenant abandons the home and the Landlord contacts Lienholder who immediately commences paying the monthly storage fees;
•	No 45-day letter is sent to anyone; 
•	Lienholder signs a storage agreement and finds a buyer; 
•	The home is sold to buyer, title is transferred, and buyer moves in; 
•	Tenant later finds out about the sale, claims that the home was worth far more than what it was sold for, and had he been notified of the abandonment, would have either sold it or at least let it go to auction and recovered back some of his ""equity""; 
•	Notwithstanding the fact that the tenant may have never entertained any intention of making any claim to the home after he left, the fact remains that his home was taken without following the letter of the law. The Landlord's only excuse for proceeding in the manner he did was that the Lienholder cooperated early in the process by making the storage payments when requested. The Tenant has the Landlord over a legal barrel, and there is really no legal defense to the claim - the abandonment statute was ignored in favor of the opportunity of receiving storage fees immediately. [Most jurors have been tenants at one time or another and would be much more sympathetic to the Tenant than the Landlord in this case.] 

The danger with this scenario is that oftentimes the landlord does not realize that they have done anything wrong - and in fact, believes that the tenant's abandonment has posed few problems for them, since the lienholder stepped up so quickly. However, all of this ignores the fact that the tenant has an outstanding claim that may not arise until months later, and the problem could easily have been avoided had the abandonment been initiated according to the law in the first place. 

Here is another doomsday scenario: 

•	Tenant abandons the home; 
•	Landlord contacts Lienholder who says it will start paying the storage fees which are $400 per month;
•	Landlord sends Lienholder a storage agreement;
•	Nothing happens. Three months go by. Landlord calls and writes Lienholder who finally says they never got the storage agreement, please send another one;
•	Another three months goes by. Finally, the issue gets to someone in the Lienholder's company who actually knows and understands ORS 90.675. They politely tell the Landlord that they have not properly commenced the abandonment - i.e. no 45-day letter has been sent to the tenant, with a copy to the Lienholder, or anyone else as required by statute - and therefore the 45-day period within which to sign the storage agreement has not even started. 
•	Landlord goes to an attorney who commences a legal abandonment. This means that the Landlord has lost six months' rent totaling $2,400 and if the Lienholder waits the full 45 days before exercising its rights, another one and one-half months (i.e. $600 more, for a total of $3,000) has been lost.1 
•	This scenario is even more outrageous if the Lienholder notifies the Landlord that they do not want to exercise their right to sign a storage agreement and abandons their right to the home. If the Landlord sent the 45-day letter out at the moment of entitlement and the Lienholder were forced to make the decision to abandon their lien earlier, the maximum loss would have been approximately two months' rent, and possibly less, depending upon the value of the home.2

In no event should landlords negotiate directly with lienholders for payment of the storage fees (with or without the use of a storage agreement) unless and until the 45-day letter has been sent to the lienholder, owner, and all of the other parties required to be notified under Oregon law.

"229","229","3","Limited Dealer License and new Federal Laws on Financing  (SAFE) when Selling an Abandoned Home","<p>Question:  According to MHCO’s recent SAFE Act article authored by Phil Querin (uploaded 12/6/2011, MHCO.ORG ""Community Updates""), a park owner wishing to sell abandoned homes on site may do so with a limited dealer’s license if they either: (a) Are licensed as a mortgage banker or broker; or, (b) Secure the services of a Mortgage Loan Originator (“MLO”).  Where do you find a MLO that can prepare loan documents in the Portland area?  Can their cost be included in the loan or can a loan origination fee be charged for their services.  If so, could MHCO issue a list of MLO's and their charges? What would I have to do to become a licensed MLO for my park?</p>
<p>Answer:  My prior article indicated that park owners holding a limited dealer’s license are subject to regulation under the SAFE Act if they “carry the paper”, i.e. enter into a retail installment contract with the tenant-purchaser.  This is because when they do so, they are making a “credit decision” about their buyer.   Park owners have two choices:</p>
<p>1.	Hire a MLO who will engage in the activities described for them under state law.  This will require the park owner to become either a mortgage banker or mortgage broker.  The reason for this is because the MLO is required to work under the supervision and control of one or the other.</p>
<p>2.	Contract with an existing MLO who is already working for an Oregon licensed mortgage banker or broker.  Presumably, this would be on an independent contractor basis.</p>
<p>The second alternative is likely more attractive in most cases, since it avoids the cost of securing a special license and then becoming an employer, with all of the regulation that this entails.  If you are interested in learning more about becoming a mortgage banker or mortgage broker, you should go the website for the Department of Consumer and Business Services (“DCBS”) here.</p>
<p>This means that your next best solution is to contract with a mortgage banker or broker to secure the services of their MLO on an independent contractor or similar basis.  MLOs are employed by mortgage bankers or brokers – they are not separately licensed as such. This means that you cannot “become” a MLO unless you want to work for a mortgage banker or broker.</p>
<p>MHCO is currently evaluating the idea of a referral list. However, as you imply, the entire lending industry is not without its own liability issues.  Accordingly, the decision to actually publish a referral list – and the implicit “endorsement” risk that comes with doing so – is something we may ultimately decline to do.  In the meantime, we suggest that you contact other MHCO members and Associate members. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the issue of costs, we know of no restrictions on recovery of loan fees and costs that are unique to MLOs.  This is not to say that the sky’s the limit, because you do not want to charge for services not actually performed, or in amounts that are not customary.  If in doubt, you should contact the DCBS at (503) 378-4100.</p>
<p>As for trying to recover the cost of the MLO as a part of the closing cost of the sale, I do not know for sure and suggest you contact the DCBS.  Alternatively, you may wish to consider simply building the cost of the MLO into the resale price of the home.  This would avoid any regulatory issues entirely.</p>
<p>Lastly, I note that your question asks about finding …”a MLO that can prepare loan documents…”  As stated in my prior SAFE article for MHCO, a loan originator is the individual whose primary job responsibilities include negotiating with a potential borrower for the purpose of establishing the terms and conditions of a mortgage loan.  <em>A loan originator does not include an individual whose responsibilities are clerical or administrative, such as gathering information, requesting information, word processing, soliciting general interest in mortgage loans, sending correspondence and assembling files.</em> Accordingly, it is my opinion that the task of “preparing loan documents” is not really something you need to pay the MLO to do.  It is discretionary functions, such as credit evaluation and negotiation of terms, that are reserved to MLOs. The merely administrative tasks can be performed by others, even your own employees or managers.</p>","<p>Question:  According to MHCO’s recent SAFE Act article authored by Phil Querin (uploaded 12/6/2011, MHCO.ORG ""Community Updates""), a park owner wishing to sell abandoned homes on site may do so with a limited dealer’s license if they either: (a) Are licensed as a mortgage banker or broker; or, (b) Secure the services of a Mortgage Loan Originator (“MLO”).

<p>As most landlords have come to learn, they are frequently the ones who become ultimately responsible for the disposition of a home when it is abandoned by the tenant.</p>
<p>If the fair market value of the home is $8,000 or less, the landlord is not required to advertise and sell.

As most landlords have come to learn, they are frequently the ones who become ultimately responsible for the disposition of a home when it is abandoned by the tenant.
If the fair market value of the home is $8,000 or less, the landlord is not required to advertise and sell. If they do not choose to sell the home, however, landlords must ""destroy or dispose"" of it. To ""dispose"" of a home means that the landlord may transfer or give it, without consideration, to a nonprofit organization or to a person unrelated to the landlord.

PHILLIP C. QUERIN, LEGAL COUNSEL MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITIES OF OREGON (“MHCO”)
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A manufactured housing community under Oregon law is one in which the resident owns and occupies the manufactured dwelling and rents the underlying space. If four or more such spaces are situated within 500 feet of each other1, it becomes subject to regulation under Oregon’s manufactured housing law, which is primarily found in ORS 90.505 et. seq.
Senate Bill 2942, which became law on June 23, 2011, was introduced by the Manufactured Housing Landlord/Tenant Coalition, which consists of community residents, park and marina owners, manufacturers, affordable housing nonprofits, submetering companies, and Oregon’s Manufactured Communities Resource Center.
Background. Historically, park owners recovered the cost of providing water [including wastewater and storm water] in one of following three ways:
o By including it in the base rent charged to all residents, aka the “base rent” method.
o By billing it to the residents separately from rent, based upon master meter readings. The calculation is normally arrived at by allocating the total charges on a per space basis, aka
the “prorata” method.
o By billing it to the residents separately from rent, based upon submeters placed on each
space.3
When water was cheap in years past, its cost was normally recovered in the landlord’s base rent. However, with rising costs and conservation concerns, both landlords and residents began to explore methods of monitoring usage, so that the cost could be spread among residents more equitably. The natural consequence of individual accountability for water usage was increased conservation, which benefited both landlords and residents – hence the growing trend toward submetering.
Senate Bill 929. In 2009, the Coalition submitted, and the Oregon Legislature passed SB 929, which required communities of 200+ spaces to convert to water submetering by December 31, 2012.4 Communities on well water were not permitted to separately charge residents based upon a master meter, i.e. “pro rata” method.5
1 ORS 446.003(23)
2 This bill dealt primarily with park submetering and conversion of parks into subdivisions. This White Paper deals only with submetering.
3 Since submeters only monitor water usage at the individual spaces, community common area usage is normally allocated to residents on a pro-rata basis from mater meter readings.
4 This mandatory requirement applied only to landlords using the master meter method where the cost was prorated among all residents. It did not apply to communities where the cost of water was included in the base rent.
5 ORS 90.532 (7)

Senate Bill 294. With its passage on June 23, 2011, SB 294 now permits an exception to SB 929’s mandatory submetering requirement for 200+ space communities that use the master meter/pro rata billing method. It requires pro rata billing method sometimes referred to as “super conservation”.6 It is important to note that SB 294 does not eliminate the mandatory conversion to submeters for 200+ space communities if they are on the master meter/pro rata billing method and do not adopt the “super conservation” rules.
SB 294 now permits all landlords who install submeters, to impose a special assessment on residents to recover for the for the cost of installation.
DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SENATE BILL 294
o General Information:
 Mandatory submetering for communities of 200+ spaces only applies if they
currently use the master meter/pro rata billing method pursuant to ORS 90.532 (1)
(b) (C) (ii).
 Manufactured housing communities will no longer be permitted to convert from
the “base rent” method of water cost recovery to a pro rata method under ORS
90.532 (3).
 The December 31, 2012 deadline imposed for 200+ space communities by SB
929 is continued.
 For communities on well water:
 They may not convert from a base rent method of recovery to a prorata method; and
 They are specifically exempted from mandatory submetering, regardless of the number of spaces.
o Super Conservation Rules [For communities using the master meter recovery method. Effective after December 31, 2012]:
 They must bill for water using the pro rata billing method by apportioning the utility provider’s charge to residents on a pro rata basis, with only the following factors being considered:
 The number of residents or occupants in the manufactured dwelling compared with the number of residents or occupants in the manufactured dwelling park [basing two-thirds (2/3) of the charge to the residents on this factor]; and
 The size of a resident’s space as a percentage of the total area of the manufactured dwelling park [basing one-third (1/3) of the charge on this factor].
 The number of residents and/or occupants in each dwelling unit and in the community must be determined at least annually. 7
6 This was an informal term used by the Coalition for ease of reference – it was not used in any pejorative sense. Its use will be continued in this White Paper.
7 Legislative history testimony of John VanLandingham, of the Lane County Legal Aid & advocacy Center, to the House Committee on General Government and Consumer Protection, May 26, 2011: “The landlord cannot use the simple per-space pro rata allocation formula. The theory is that those tenants with more occupants should pay

 Requires adoption of other conservation measures:
 Annual testing of pipes and appliance for leaks at no charge to residents;
results are to be made available to them; applies to common areas as well.
 Residents are required to permit access under ORS 90.725, if necessary
for landlord to conduct test.
 Landlord is required to repair any significant leaks in common areas.
 Landlord may require that residents repair any significant leaks found
inside their dwellings within a “reasonable time”.8
 Landlord are required to repair leaks in pipes located on resident’s space
that connect to the dwelling.9
 Resident’s failure to repair a significant leak after request may be evicted
following two written notices - one to make the repair and the other to
comply with the notice of termination provisions of ORS 90.630.10
 A resident adversely affected by a landlord’s noncompliance with the mandatory submetering law [or the super conservation exceptions] may sue to enforce
compliance and recover damages.
o Caveats11:
 Super conservation only applies to landlords covered by SB 929, i.e. 200+ space
communities using the master meter/prorata billing method.
 Small communities under 200 spaces may not test a resident’s dwelling unit for
water leaks.
 Super conservation methods do not apply to marinas.
 Although these provisions deal with billing residents for water usage, since most
municipalities charge for wastewater and storm water based upon water usage, SB
294 applies to these charges as well.
 ORS 90.510 (4) (b) governs the landlord’s right to unilaterally amend a rental
agreement [i.e. without resident consent]. This statute is amended by SB 294 to expressly permit landlords to convert to the super conservation pro rata billing method via unilateral amendment of the residents’ rental agreement.

￼more, on the assumption that more occupants consume more water, and on the additional assumption that those tenants with larger spaces are likely to use more water for watering lawns or plants. This is not as fair as individual submeters, but it is fairer than everyone paying the same no matter what. The proportion-of-residents-in-the- dwelling concept already exists as an allowable billing method in ORS 90.534 (2) (c) (B).”
8 Note: This follows the same approach as found in the repair and deterioration statute, ORS 90.632(7), which specifically itemizes timing considerations such as weather and other conditions outside of a resident’s control.
9 Note: This is an obligation that did not previously exist in the pre-SB 294 version of ORS 90.730, which describes landlord obligations to residents.
10JVL Legislative History: “This could be a harsh result, but the alternative is allowing water to be wasted, driving up costs for everyone in the park, not just the tenant with the leak.”]
11 JVL Legislative History: “The coalition views the significant changes in existing law here -- regarding leaks and testing, for example -- as an experiment, limited to the SB 929 parks; the coalition will monitor how this experiment works, for possible future tweaking or expansion.”

o Changes to ORS 90.532 [Billing methods for utility or service charges; system maintenance; restriction on charging for water]
 Allows pro rata billing for water for new residents if the rest of the park is already using pro rata billing. 12
 Note: New prorata billing arrangements have been continuously prohibited since 2009 by SB 772, even with mutual landlord-resident agreement.
 Applies to new rental agreements and mutually amended rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010.
 New communities, or those expanding over 200 spaces, may only use submetering for water.
 Allows landlords to use electronic mail [“e-mail”] to bill residents monthly for any utility or service charges that are billed separate from rent if permitted by the rental agreement. [Note: Landlord may not unilaterally amend rental agreement to do so. It must be consensual.]
o Changes to ORS 90.536 [Charges for utilities or services measured by submeter]13
 Corrects an error in current law that permitted billing for stormwater based upon water use as measured by a submeter. However, only wastewater is normally
billed by utility companies in this manner.14 Now, the landlord may only bill for:
 The cost of any sewer service for wastewater as a percentage of the resident’s water charge as measured by a submeter, if the utility or service provider charges the landlord for sewer service as a percentage of water
provided; or,
 A pro rata portion of the cost of sewer service for storm water and
wastewater if the utility or service provider does not charge the landlord
for sewer service as a percentage of water provided.
 Permits landlords to add a pro rata charge for common areas.
 Landlords will be allowed to include the cost of a third party billing service for
reading the meters and handling the billing process. [Note: This is limited to water submetering and super conservation billing methods only.]
o Changes to ORS 90.537 [Conversion of billing method for utility or service charges]15
 The amount of base rent reduction required upon submeter conversion may not be less than an amount reasonably comparable to the amount of the rent previously allocated to the utility or service cost averaged over at least the preceding one year. [Previously, it was six months.]
 Previously, landlords were prohibited from directly assessing residents for the
12 JVL Legislative History: “The rationale is that it would be inefficient to submeter a few spaces with new tenants or to use the [base] rent recovery method for a few new tenants when the rest of the park already uses pro rata billing.”
13 See, ORS 90.534 for charges based upon the pro rata billing method.
14 Note: ORS 90.315 was changed to distinguish between stormwater and wastewater in order to be consistent with the 2011 changes to ORS 90.536.
15 Note: This statute is not limited to water submetering.

cost of submeter installation. This has now been changed.16
 As an option only, a landlord may levy an assessment for actual post-
installation [not anticipated pre-installation] cost, with resident repayment spread over not less than 60 months - to be included with the utility or service charge.17 The installation cost may include related capital costs, e.g. upgrading water lines required to handle higher water pressure.
 Note: This right of assessment is limited to manufactured housing communities, not marinas; it may be any size park; and it can be used for any utility installation, not only water.
 Miscellaneous:
 Landlords converting to submeters may unilaterally switch to the pro rata
billing method for common areas. [However, this change should be
included in the landlord’s initial 180-day notice of intent to submeter.]
 If the landlord continues to recover water charges for common areas from base rent, he/she may offset against the rent reduction an amount reflecting the cost of serving the common areas. If the utility or service provider cannot provide the landlord with an accurate cost for the service to the common areas, the landlord “...shall assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed.” [Note: This offset is not available if the landlord chooses to bill for the common area water using the pro rata method.]
o Changes to ORS 90.730 [Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition]
 Expands the habitability requirements for common areas as follows: “If supplied or required to be supplied by the landlord to a common area, a water supply system, sewage disposal system or system for disposing of storm water, ground water and subsurface water approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the system can be controlled by the landlord.”
o Changes to ORS 446.062 [Rules regulating parks; state building code requirements; approval for new construction or additional lots]
 For anticipated cost savings, allows for installation of community submeters to be treated as “...a minor plumbing installation*** performed under a statewide permit and inspection system for minor construction work....”
16 JVL Legislative History: “This change reflects our new understanding that submeter installation may be significantly more expensive ($250 to $800 per meter) than we thought in 2005 ($50 per meter). At an average installation cost of $500, the cost to install submeters in a 200 space park would be $100,000. Given current problems securing private market financing for anything, and the lack of any public financing, the coalition worried about how landlords would pay for installation. Landlords could, of course, raise the rent to cover the cost (though current law requires a six month waiting period), but tenants generally fear that rent increases never go down -- meaning that a landlord who raised the rent to cover the cost of submeter installation would not lower the rent after the installation was paid for. And current law prohibits including the cost of installation in a utility or service charge; ORS 90.536 (3).”
17 Query: May the cost recovery be carried over to a new resident if the existing resident sells and/or removes the home? In fairness, it would seem so.

"333","333","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Additional Government Fees ","Question. The City of Gresham is now charging a “Public Safety Fee” on every mobile home space in the city.  It starts at $2.40/month/space and escalates to $7.19/month/space in June.  Park owners have to pay the fee for all residents and then try to collect it back from them.  If the residents have their own utility accounts with the City, they pay their fee directly, but most parks pay water and sewer utilities in bulk.

What can you tell me about this Public Safety Fee, and whether I can treat it as a utility or service, and pass it through to park residents?

Answer.  First, one caveat:  This Answer is not intended to constitute legal advice.  It is educational only, and should not be relied upon by an MHCO member in lieu of consulting their own legal counsel, who is familiar with their own specific factual situation.

Let’s start with a definition of a “utility” under Oregon’s Residential Landlord Tenant Act.  Like all legislation coming out of Salem, there is no easy answer.  The statute is found at ORS 90.315.  I will try to summarize the relevant portions for purposes of this Answer:  

Oregon Law.  90.315 Utility or service payments; additional charges; responsibility for utility or service; remedies.  
•	A “Utility or service” includes but is not limited to electricity, natural or liquid propane gas, oil, water, hot water, heat, air conditioning, cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services, Internet access or usage, sewer service and garbage collection and disposal. [Italics mine. PCQ]
•	A landlord must disclose to the tenant in writing at or before the commencement of the tenancy any utility or service that the tenant pays directly to a utility or service provider that benefits, directly, the landlord or other tenants. A tenant’s payment for a given utility or service benefits the landlord or other tenants if the utility or service is delivered to any area other than the tenant’s dwelling unit. [Italics mine.]
o	If a landlord knowingly fails to disclose such payments, the tenant may recover twice the actual damages sustained or one month’s rent, whichever is greater.
•	A utility or service charge may only include the cost of the utility or service as billed to the landlord by the provider. 
o	A landlord may add an additional amount to a utility or service charge billed to the tenant if:
•	The utility or service charge to which the additional amount is added is for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage; 
•	The additional amount is not more than 10 percent of the utility or service charge billed to the tenant;
•	The total of the utility or service charge and the additional amount is less than the typical periodic cost the tenant would incur if the tenant contracted directly with the provider for the cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;
•	The written rental agreement must describe the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge; and
•	Any billing or notice from the landlord regarding the utility or service charge lists the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge.
•	A landlord may not require a tenant to agree to the amendment of an existing rental agreement, and may not terminate a tenant for refusing to agree to the amendment of a rental agreement, if the amendment would obligate the tenant to pay an additional amount for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage.
•	A utility or service charge, including any additional amounts added pursuant to the provisions immediately above, is not rent or a fee. 
•	Nonpayment of a utility or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause.
•	If a landlord fails to comply with the paragraphs above regarding disclosure of the additional charges, the tenant may recover from the landlord an amount equal to one month’s periodic rent or twice the amount wrongfully charged to the tenant, whichever is greater.

Without getting into a detailed discussion of the pass-through laws contained in ORS 90.531 – 90.530, suffice it to say that subject to several limitations, park landlords are permitted to pass through utility and service charges to their tenants. So assuming that the landlord’s pass-through program was legally implemented and is legally described in the written rental agreement, the issue is whether the City of Gresham’s “Public Safety Fee” constitutes a “utility or service,” as described in ORS 90.315(1)(b), which provides that it includes but is not limited to:
“…electricity, natural or liquid propane gas, oil, water, hot water, heat, air conditioning, cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services, Internet access or usage, sewer service and garbage collection and disposal.”  

Clearly, the statute, by its own terms, says that a “utility or service” can include more than what is described above. Unfortunately, it gives no guidance as to what that might be. A quick online check of Oregon definitions, seem to presuppose a “public utility”; e.g. sewer, water and electricity.  How, the definition of “utility” is much more generic, i.e. “something useful.”  Moreover, we can see from the examples given in the ORS 90.315(1)(b), that several are not publicly owned.   And the word “service” is so open-ended as to defy a specific definition, other than “something provided.”

Accordingly, the definition of a “utility or service” is not rigidly defined by ORS 90.315, and, depending on the circumstances, can include charges for “useful things or services” imposed by a government body, even though they were not specifically enumerated in ORS 90.315(1)(b).

City of Gresham’s Explanation. Now let’s look at the City of Gresham; how do they describe it and what is it intended to do?  On its website explaining the fee, the City goes to great lengths to call it “temporary.”  It is a single line-item that is added to customers’ water bills. It appears under the heading “Residential Utility Charges.”

The Gresham website explanation of the fee is the following: “The temporary Police, Fire and Parks Fee *** goes into effect Feb. 1 for single-family households, multifamily property owners and businesses to help maintain essential police positions and keep our fire stations open. The per-unit fee was shaped by a public input process in 2012 and includes a phase-in for multifamily properties.”

The website’s FAQs add the following points: 
•	95% of the fee proceeds will be used to support public safety services. The remaining five percent will go toward Parks.
•	Whether or not the fee will be passed on to a tenant will be determined by the lease or rental agreement.
•	Financial assistance is available to those who qualify. A rental assistance program has been created to help low-income families and individuals pay the fee. Contact Human Solutions at 503-548-0200. The City offers an assistance program that provides emergency funds to help qualified utility customers that are experiencing financial hardship. Apply for the utility bill assistance program at 503-618-2373. Non-profit housing providers who own and operate multifamily properties that are restricted as low-income housing by a recorded regulatory agreement or by the Office of Housing and Urban Development may be eligible for assistance. For more information contact Rachael Fuller at 503-618-2255 or Rachael.Fuller@GreshamOregon.gov.
•	Owners of multifamily properties will be charged the fee per unit in the building.  However, those with more than three units have been granted a gradual phase-in period. These property owners will pay: A 4.1% vacancy discount will be applied to the fee for all multifamily development. Multi-family property owners will pay:
o	$2.50 per unit for February-March
o	$5 per unit for April-May
o	$7.50 per unit from June 2013-June 2014
Conclusion.   I have not conducted an in-depth evaluation of this issue or the law.  Subject to that limitation, it appears to me that a good argument can be made that the Public Safety Fee is either a utility or a fee, and as such, may be properly passed through to community residents.  And since it is a prorated flat fee, it cannot be said to benefit other tenants or the landlord.   
If and when passed through, it should certainly be explained to the residents, and appear as a separate line item on their invoice.

"482","482","3","Phil Querin Question and Answer:  Can You Update Late Fees","Question: Our late fees have remained the same for several years, and we want to increase them. What are the current rules about doing so? 

Answer:  Here is a summary of ORS 90.260, the late fee statute.  

(1)	 A landlord may impose a late charge or fee, however designated, only if:
•	The rent payment is not received by the fourth day of the period for which rent is payable; and
•	There exists a written rental agreement that specifies:
o	The tenant’s obligation to pay a late charge;
o	The type and amount of the late charge; and
o	The date on which rent payments are due, and the date on which late charges become due.

(2)	The amount of any late charge may not exceed:
•	A reasonable flat amount, charged once per rental period. “Reasonable amount” means the customary amount charged by landlords for that rental market;
•	A reasonable amount, charged on a per-day basis, beginning on the fifth day of the rental period for which rent is delinquent. This daily charge may accrue every day thereafter until the rent (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only. The per-day charge may not exceed six percent of the amount of the “reasonable flat amount”, described above; or
•	Five percent of the periodic rent payment amount, charged once for each succeeding five-day period, or portion thereof, for which the rent payment is delinquent, beginning on the fifth day of that rental period and continuing until that rent payment (not including any late charge), is paid in full, through that rental period only.

(3)	In periodic tenancies [e.g. month-to-month], a landlord may change the type or amount of late charge by giving 30 days’ written notice to the tenant.

(4)	A landlord may not deduct a previously imposed late charge from a current or subsequent rental period rent payment in order to make the rent payment short so as to issue a 72-hour notice of nonpayment.

(5)	A landlord may charge simple interest on an unpaid late charge at the rate allowed for judgments (9.00%) and accruing from the date the late charge is imposed.

(6)	Nonpayment of a late charge alone is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause by using a curable 30-day written notice of termination.  [Note: The landlord may identify the late charge on the 72-hour notice of nonpayment of rent, so long as it makes clear that the tenant may cure the nonpayment notice by paying only the delinquent rent, not including any late charge.]

"246","246","3","Phil Querin Q&A   Temporary Occupants  and Implications for  Rules and Regulations Screening  and Eviction","<p><strong>Question:</strong> The law and MHCO ocupancy agreement both state that a landlord can screen an occupant for conduct or criminal history but not for credit history or income level.  If after screening a temporary occupant, the findings reveal that they have civil case(s) and/or eviction matters relating to previous rental history where the derogatory rental reference is financial (not necessarily bad personal conduct).  Can this be grounds for denial?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Not in my opinion.  The temporary occupant agreement concept is that the person is not going to be a “co-renter”. They are being permitted to come onto the space as an accommodation by the landlord to the current resident who wants them there.  If they are to become a temporary occupant, but your background check inadvertently reveals derogatory references related to financial information, and that concerns you, then limit the amount of time they can remain there, and take things a month, or six months, at a time.  You might consider having tenants fill out a form in advance explaining exactly why they want the temporary occupant there.  If a tenant wants them there to share the rental obligation then you should know that before offering the temporary occupant status.  If that is the case, then have them apply as a tenant.  If they don’t pass the financial background check, then reject them on that basis.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> The temporary occupancy agreement states that the temporary occupant must comply with the laws/Rules Regulations &amp; Policies of the community.  Who is responsible to provide this information to the temporary occupant and when should it be given?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I understand that the temporary occupant law does not specifically address this point.  But you have the most to lose if the rules are not given to them at the outset of the temporary occupant relationship.  That being the case, I would suggest you append the rules to the temporary occupant agreement, and have them sign both the agreement and the attached rules.  Then there is no question about whether they got them.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> The temporary occupant agreement and the law state that a temporary occupant can be terminated “for cause” if there is a material violation of the occupancy agreement and that the temporary occupant does not have a right to cure the violation.  The other option is termination by automatic expiration of the agreement (if the box is checked that specifies this).  If the landlord needs to issue a for cause termination (instead of termination by automatic expiration) the termination must be done in accordance with the law outlined in ORS 90.392 (for non-MHP tenancies) or 90.630 (for MHP tenancies).  However after reading these statutes, they do not give an option for the landlord to issue a for cause notice with no right to cure. How is a landlord supposed to issue a for cause termination notice with no right to cure and have it held up in court?  If a landlord issues a for cause notice with no right to cure, what form should be used and what is the time frame for the termination?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The temporary occupant law is addressed in ORS 90.275. You may terminate the temporary occupant for a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement.  That agreement also terminates by its own terms when it expires (if you checked that box on the form). The law says that upon termination or expiration, the temporary occupant shall “promptly vacate.”  If they don’t, then the landlord can issue a for cause termination under 90.630 (for MHP tenancies) to the tenant – not the temporary occupant.  That means you would issue a termination notice under 90.630 for the tenant to vacate if the temporary occupant failed to do so as required.  The opportunity to cure is for the tenant to get the temporary occupant to vacate.    If they temporary occupant fails to vacate within the 30-day cure period given by law to the tenant, then the entire space tenancy is terminated.  In such case, the law says the temporary occupant – if they remain – is treated as a “squatter.”  ORS 90.403 then permits you to give a 24-hour non-curable termination notice to the “squatter”  and evict, if necessary, through the normal FED process.</p>","<p><strong>Question:</strong> The law and MHCO ocupancy agreement both state that a landlord can screen an occupant for conduct or criminal history but not for credit history or income level.

<p>So, you see, this simply isn’t addressed in the landlord-tenant law.  Nor should it be.  Clearly, the resident leaving the religious material in the clubhouse could, if he or she wanted, go door to door proselytizing, unless and until others complained.

<p>If the landlord knows who is doing this, perhaps a personal discussion with them might be in order. But telling them to “stop” because a single person is offended seems unnecessary.  If there is a place in the clubhouse for storage of reading materials, perhaps removing the literature to that location would work.  Certainly, no rule change prohibiting placement of materials in the clubhouse (just because they are religious) is unnecessary.  Management cannot be responsible for controlling the placement of written materials in the clubhouse unless it is offensive, inappropriate for minors and guests.   This is what free speech is all about.  My view would be the same regardless of the denomination of the literature.  If I’m incorrect, I’m sure I will hear about it.</p>

The tenant claims that the landlord must accept the partial payment.  What are the landlord's options?  Can the landlord refuse the partial payment?  Where do you draw the line - say a 72 hour notice has been issued - does that change the partial payment scenario?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Oregon landlord-tenant law does not “require” that a landlord accept partial payments.  To the contrary, it provides that it is a “tenant’s duty regarding rent payments is to tender to the landlord an offer of the full amount of rent owed within the time allowed by law and by the rental agreement….”</p>
<p>A landlord may refuse to accept the tender of partial rent of rent that is not paid on time. However, if the landlord agrees to accept a partial payment of rent he/she may do so, although it should be clearly described in a well-drafted written agreement.</p>
<p>Such partial payments do not constitute a waiver of the right to later demand prompt performance in the future.  Nor do they prevent the landlord from terminating the tenancy if the balance of the rent is not paid as agreed.</p>
<p>However, there are some pitfalls that the landlord must be aware of: Acceptance of a partial payment waives the right of termination if accepted after issuance of a 72-hour or 144-hour notice of termination.</p>
<p>When presented with a partial payment issue, landlords are wise to closely review ORS 90.417.  Lastly, consistent application is important – i.e. if the landlord has permitted partial payments by some residents, he/she would be hard-pressed to disallow others the right to do so without good reason.    Here are a summary of how ORS 90.417 applies to this case:</p>
<p>•	A tenant’s duty regarding rent payments is to tender to the landlord an offer of the full amount of rent owed within the time allowed by law and by the rental agreement.</p>
<p>•	A landlord may refuse to accept a rent tender that is for less than the full amount of rent owed or that is untimely.</p>
<p>•	A landlord may accept a partial payment of rent. Doing so does not constitute a waiver, if properly documented.  Here is what the landlord must do to avoid waiver: o	The partial payment must have been made before the landlord issued a 72-hour or 144-hour notice for nonpayment. o	The landlord must enter into a written agreement with the tenant stating that the acceptance does not constitute waiver.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>o	The agreement should provide that the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as provided in the Oregon FED laws if the tenant fails to pay <span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>the balance of the rent by a time certain.</p>
<p><span style=""white-space: pre;""> </span>o	The tenant must agree in writing to pay the balance by a date/time certain.</p>
<p>•	If the balance is not paid according to this written agreement, the landlord may serve a 72-hour or 144-hour nonpayment of rent notice – but it must be served no earlier than would have been permitted under the rental agreement and the law, had no rent been accepted.</p>
<p>•	Notwithstanding a landlord’s acceptance of a partial payment of rent, the tenant continues to owe the landlord the unpaid balance of the rent. In other words, acceptance of partial rent does not eliminate the duty to pay the balance.</p>","<p><strong>Question:</strong> A resident stops by the manager’s office on the 5th of the month and offers to pay $150 of the $350 of rent that is due, and promising to pay the remaining $200 by the 15th of the month.

(b) Can he bid during the sealed bid process?  (c) If no one bids on the house can the landlord purchase the house and at what price?

Answer:  All good questions.  The entire statute, which is lengthy, is found at ORS 90.675. 

(a)	Can a landlord acquire a home that is in abandonment?  Yes. Assuming that the abandonment process has been formally commenced, the landlord would have to wait for the 45 day period to expire and then if the property was over $8,000, it would have to be advertised and sold via sealed bid.  The landlord can bid, but must make sure that the bid is high enough that it’s not going to be snapped up by another higher bid.  If the property is worth $8,000 or less, the landlord could dismantle or give away to a non-profit organization.  But if the landlord wanted the home, he would have to advertise and auction and then pay the property taxes and could acquire it.  

(b)	Can he or she bid during the sealed bid process?  Yes, as mentioned above.  However, sealed bids mean sealed bids – no free peek by the landlord, so he knows how much to make his bid for.  The playing field must be level.  

(c)	If no one bids on the house can the landlord purchase it and at what price?  Generally this should not come up, since the landlord would normally put in his own “protective bid” which is just a credit bid and represents the amount of costs and fees he’s got into the abandonment process.  Thus, if no one else were to bid, the landlord would acquire it for the “protective bid.”  

The above discussion does not factor in what happens if there is a lender.  If there is, then the entire time frame is subject to what the lender does.  If it signs and returns the Storage Agreement, then the lender will have the right to try to sell the property itself. However, if the lender does not sign and return the Storage Agreement, or otherwise fails to respond to the landlord, then its interest is “conclusively presumed to be abandoned.”  

Note, however, that when the home is advertised prior to the private auction, the invitation to bid submitted to the newspaper for publishing must also be provided to the lender – even though it didn’t respond to the original 45-day notice.  This is sometimes forgotten, since landlords assume that if the lender didn’t respond or timely exercise their right to sell the property, they don’t have a right to know when the auction is held.  They do have the right to know, and the right to bid.  Forgetting this can create headaches for landlords after they have sold the property to someone else.

The landlord wants to mail a non-payment of rent notice, and would like proof that the notice was received by the resident.  Can the landlord mail the notice as a ""Certificate of Mailing""?

Answer:  If the tenant has left the home, this does not mean that the landlord’s non-payment of rent notices must follow the tenant around the country in order to be effective.  Rather, in cases where the tenant apparently abandons the home (or at least is ignoring his/her space rent responsibilities while gone), the landlord should send the 72-hour notice to the tenant at the tenant’s space.  If the tenant has another address known to the landlord, he an send a “courtesy copy” so marked, with an advisory that the original was sent to the space.  Upon expiration of the 72 hours without payment, the landlord may file for eviction. If the tenant does not show up at the first appearance, the landlord may obtain a judgment of restitution and recover back possession of the space.  Then the landlord may send out a 45-day abandonment letter.  A Certificate of Mailing (this is not “certified mail”) is always useful when sending notices, and certainly appropriate here.

"295","295","3","Phil Querin Q&A Partial Rent Payment & Allocation to Utilities, Fees etc.","Question:  Increasingly some of our residents are bringing only partial rent payments. So how does a partial payment get allocated when some of the payment includes utilities?  For example, if the rent is $650 including a certain amount allocated to utilities, how does the landlord handle this?  Pay the rent portion and then go after the utility payments via a 30 day notice?  

Answer:  Be aware that utility charges, late fees, etc. are not “rent.”  Rent is the charge for the resident’s right to remain at the space.  As you know from the MHCO 72-hour Notice, the right to evict only arises when the rent remains unpaid for seven days following the date of payment, which is usually the first of the month. The extra charges for late fees, utilities, and other expenses the landlord has a right to collect under the rental or lease agreement do not provide the basis for eviction under the 72-hour Notice.  A landlord’s right to terminate a tenancy for payment of non-rent charges can be handled in two ways: (a) By issuance of a 30-day notice of termination; or (b) Small Claims Court. 

If the resident’s payment does not include 100% of the rent that is due, that is a different story.  In that case, the landlord does not have to accept partial rent.  However, if a landlord is willing to do so, he/she must secure a written agreement. 

Here’s what ORS 90.417 says:
•	A landlord may accept a partial payment of rent. 
•	If the acceptance of a partial payment of rent is in accordance with the following protocol, it does not constitute a waiver of the landlord’s right to terminate the tenancy for nonpayment of the balance of the rent owed.  
•	Here is the required protocol:  Acceptance of a partial payment of rent waives the right of the landlord to terminate the tenant’s rental agreement for nonpayment of rent unless:
o	 The landlord accepted the partial payment of rent before he/she gave a nonpayment of rent notice based on the tenant’s agreement to pay the balance by a time certain and the tenant does not pay the balance of the rent as agreed;
o	The landlord’s 72-hour notice must be served no earlier than it would have been permitted under the 72-hour notice statute, had no rent been accepted; and
o	The notice permits the tenant to avoid termination of the tenancy for nonpayment of rent by paying the balance within 72 hours or 144 hours, as the case may be, or by any date to which the parties agreed, whichever is later; or 
o	 The landlord accepted a partial payment of rent after giving a nonpayment of rent termination notice and entered into a written agreement with the tenant that the acceptance does not constitute waiver. The written agreement may provide that the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and file for eviction without serving a new 72-hour notice if the tenant fails to pay the balance of the rent by a time certain.
             
•	Note that a landlord and tenant may by written agreement provide that monthly rent can be paid in regular installments of less than a month pursuant to a schedule specified in the agreement. Such installment rent payments are not partial payment of rent under ORS 90.417.

However, we are confused about the 80/20 rules and the possibility of losing our 55+ status. What is a safe margin for occupancy limits?  And if our community percentage is 85%, are we required to rent the 15% remainder to families with children?  

Answer:  You must have at least one person who is 55 years of age or older living in at least 80% of its occupied units. This 80/20 rule is critical.   Generally, communities strive to be over 80%, since falling below 80% occupancy [even upon death of a qualifying 55+ resident] means immediate disqualification.  Does this mean that your 15% safety margin must be reserved for families with children?  The answer is “No.”  In fact, a 55+ community should strive for 100% occupancy by persons age 55 or over.  Does it mean that community management must accept otherwise qualified age 55+ applicants when the second or subsequent person occupant is 18 years of age?  Again, the answer is “No.”  If desired, a 55+ community may impose a minimum age requirement for the second or subsequent occupant to 25 years, 30 years, or even 55+ years.   

However, it is also important for you to publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent to operate as a 55+ community. This requirement is fairly self-explanatory; i.e. you should make sure that in all advertising, rules, rental agreements, and  policies, you always hold the community out as a 55+ facility.  

Lastly, you must comply with HUD’s age verification of occupancy procedures to substantiate compliance with the requirement that at least 80% of the community is intended to be occupied by at least one person age 55 or over. The law provides that the following documents are considered reliable for such verification: (1) Driver’s license; (2) Birth certificate; (3) Passport; (4) Immigration card; (5) Military identification; (6) Any other state, local, national, or international official documents containing a birth date of comparable reliability or; (7) A certification in a lease, application, affidavit, or other document signed by an adult member of the household asserting that at least one person in the unit is 55 years of age or older.

As new managers, we are concerned about being able to spot problem issues before they get out of control.  What are some of the major management mistakes we should watch out for? 

Answer:  There are several issues that I see repeatedly.  Here are a few:

1.	Managers not adequately papering their file before taking legal action against a resident.  Judges want to see that you’ve “walked the extra mile” with the resident, making every reasonable effort to bring them into compliance.  This means starting with a personal conversation with them about the problem and then making notes of the date, time, and matters discussed and the resident’s responses. Next try a note or letter without using a formal termination notice.  Only after it becomes apparent that you will have to go the formal route should you do so.  

2.	Failing to act promptly when a resident violate the rules.  Although many things are not waivable, such as maintenance violations, some definitely are, such as unpermitted pets or occupants.  When there is a belief that the resident has either an unapproved pet or occupant, the resident should be contacted immediately.  With pets (assuming they are not in violation of the rules against breeds, or numbers), you want to promptly get them onto a Pet Agreement.  With occupants you should use the Occupancy Agreement and run a background check.  (Make sure you don’t require a financial background check, since that is not permitted on occupants – only tenants.)  If the resident delays in complying, get a 30-day notice issued and do not accept rent until the matter is resolved.  I have seen too many managers accept rent and work for months with the resident, not realizing that they are being lulled into believing the resident will ultimately cooperate – until it’s too late.

3.	Failing to properly prepare a notice of termination.  Oregon law is very strict when it comes to the preparation of notices.  Even the slightest error can be fatal.  Make sure you’re using the correct MHCO form [e.g. don’t use a 30-day notice for failure to maintain under ORS 90.630, when you should be using a 30-day notice for repair and deterioration under ORS 90.632.]  When you draft the notice, have someone else read it for content and accuracy.  Then do so again yourself.  If you realize that you sent out an incorrectly prepared notice, send out a corrected one and state that it rescinds and replaces the incorrect one.   

4.	Accepting residents you have doubts about.  Always do a “gut-check.”  If you think the applicant would be problematic, look closely at their application and references.  While you cannot and should not reject applicants arbitrarily, if they are on the cusp – i.e. you could legitimately accept or reject - give careful consideration to your decision and don’t let it be dictated by your desire to just fill a space. 

5.	Not understanding the range of solutions when dealing with a residents.  By this I mean, don’t just fire out a notice as a knee jerk reaction to a violation.  A good example is a resident who is intoxicated and gets into a verbal altercation with another resident.  Say it gets out of control, and threats are made by the resident.   If this is unusual for the resident and out of character for him, don’t simply send a 24-hour notice.  The law is quite clear that you are not to use a 24-hour notice if another form of notice, e.g. a curable 30-day notice would work.  Remember, a repeat violation with six months following the date of the 30-day notice gives you the right to terminate with a 20-day non-curable notice.  Judges don’t like to terminate manufactured housing residents, given the drastic consequences.  You want to show the judge that you were not being heavy-handed, but tried the most rationale and reasonable approach first.

"303","303","3","Phil Querin Q&A Trees - Liability and Responsibility ","Question.  Our community is relatively small and the spaces are oversized.  Large trees are located on many of them.  Occasionally, a resident asks us to thin or top some of the trees on their space, because of fear that during high winds they could break, damaging homes and injuring people.  I have been under the impression that tree maintenance is a tenant responsibility under Oregon law.  If so, what is our liability if tree limbs – or entire trees - break during bad weather?  

Answer:  Oregon law addresses tenant responsibilities in ORS 90.740.  Subsection (4)(h) says that except as provided in the rental agreement it is the tenant’s responsibility to “(m)aintain, water and mow or prune any trees, shrubbery or grass on the rented space….”

In my opinion, this provision is a good example of how not to draft a statute.  Trees are not “mowed” and grass is not “pruned.”  However, it is correct that “pruning” of trees [whatever that entails] is a tenant responsibility unless otherwise provided in the rental or lease agreement.

As with everything these days, the Internet is replete with discussions and definitions of pruning. One example is found here: http://tinyurl.com/Q-Law-Definitions-pruning. Regardless of your reference source, it is clear that there are many, many, different types of pruning, depending upon the goal sought.  You can prune to “teach” a tree or shrub how to grow in a particular fashion; you can prune for appearance; you can prune for maintenance, i.e. the health of the tree or shrub.  Lastly, you prune for safety - this is called “hazard pruning.” 

Putting my “lawyer’s hat” on and returning to my law school roots, I recall a rule of interpretation called “ejusdem generis”.  Here is one definition:
“(eh-youse-dem generous) v adj. Latin for ""of the same kind,"" used to interpret loosely written statutes. Where a law lists specific classes of persons or things and then refers to them in general, the general statements only apply to the same kind of persons or things specifically listed. Example: if a law refers to automobiles, trucks, tractors, motorcycles and other motor-powered vehicles, ""vehicles"" would not include airplanes, since the list was of land-based transportation.” http://www.legal-explanations.com/definitions/ejusdem-generis.htm 

Applying that legal rule to ORS 90.740(4)(h), it could reasonably be argued that the words “maintain, water and mow or prune” are intended to refer to normal and routine landscaping activities.  In other words, a tenant’s landscaping responsibility for his or her own space is limited to normal and routine activities.  In other words, imposing a statutory duty and financial responsibility of “hazard pruning” on manufactured housing residents was unlikely. 

ORS 90.730(3) provides that “(f)or purposes of this section, a rented space is considered inhabitable if it substantially lacks: (e) At the time of commencement of the rental agreement, buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin [underscore mine];”
Thus, there is little question that as of the commencement of the tenancy, it is a landlord duty to make sure the community grounds, including the spaces and common areas, are safe for “normal and reasonably foreseeable uses….”  Is a 40-foot fir tree “safe” at the commencement of the tenancy?  Can it be made safe?  If it is made safe, e.g. by hazard trimming, will it stay safe for the entire duration of the tenancy?  

It seems to me that a community landlord has two choices:

1.	Doing nothing, and relying upon a poorly drafted statute for absolute immunity when a giant tree falls, killing an entire family during a windstorm; or 
 
2.	Envision the Doomsday Scenario – i.e. assume that such a disaster could occur regardless what a poorly drafted statute says, and that a multi-million wrongful death lawsuit will surely be filed by some aggressive plaintiff’s attorney, arguing to a jury that the landlord owns the ground, owns the trees coming out of the ground, and is simply trying to avoid the financial responsibility to thin and top dangerous trees.  

So my advice would be the following: (a) If you are in doubt about your legal responsibilities because the law is unclear, and (b) where doing nothing could place lives in danger, it is far better to undertake the financial responsibility of hazard pruning on a regular basis. In short, relying upon ORS 90.740(4)(h) when it comes to trimming and topping potentially dangerous trees, could be a serious and costly mistake.

While I don’t have an objection to the formation of a tenant association, I am concerned that giving out residents’ names and addresses might violate some tenant rights on our part.  Can you help?   

Answer:  ORS Chapter 90, the Oregon Residential Landlord Tenant Act, is replete with references to tenant associations. Residents clearly have many rights when it comes to the formation of an association, including the right of assembly and the right to canvass other residents. However, nowhere does the law say that park owners and managers have a legal duty to provide individual contact information to other residents, regardless of the purpose for which it is sought.

Here is what ORS 90.750 [“Right to assemble or canvass in facility; limitations”] says on the matter:

•	No park bylaw, rental agreement, regulation or rule shall infringe upon resident rights to:
o	Peaceably assemble in an open public meeting for any lawful purpose, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, in the common areas or recreational areas; reasonable times are the hours of 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.
o	To communicate or assemble among themselves, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, for the purpose of discussing any matter, including but not limited to any matter relating to the park, or manufactured dwelling living. 
•	The discussions may be held in the common areas or recreational areas of the facility, including halls or centers, or any resident’s home. 
•	However, the landlord may enforce reasonable rules and regulations including but not limited to place, scheduling, occupancy densities and utilities.
•	A landlord may not prohibit any resident from canvassing other persons in the same facility for certain prescribed purposes. The term “canvassing” includes door-to-door contact, an oral or written request, the distribution, circulation, posting or publication of a notice or newsletter, a general announcement or any other matter relevant to the membership of a tenants’ association. 
•	However, a landlord is not required to permit any person to solicit money, except that a tenants’ association member, whether or not a tenant of the facility, may personally collect delinquent dues owed by an existing member of a tenants’ association.
•	Lastly, the statute clarifies that it is not intended to require a landlord to permit any person to disregard a tenant’s request not to be canvassed. 

To me, this last provision suggests an answer to your question, as it acknowledges that some residents may not want to be “canvassed.”  In other words, they have certain rights not to be disturbed, and may request management’s assistance in preventing it from occurring.  

Accordingly, my view is that before contact information is shared by management with other residents, advance consent should be received from each affected person.  Without such consent, I would be very hesitant to give out the information.  Certainly, the resident seeking the contact information can try to obtain it by going door-to-door and asking for it.   

If community management already maintains a published directory of residents that contains names and addresses, I suppose consent is implied by the lapse of time, assuming that everyone knows of the directory.  But I would not recommend this practice, and certainly would not share the information with other residents.  

My conclusions are based not so much on some legal duty of “confidentiality” or legally protectable “right of privacy.” With the Internet, it’s hard to say much of our private information is legally protectable any more.  My feeling is a practical one: If there is no affirmative legal duty to provide the information, and there is some risk, however remote, that sharing it without advance consent could anger some residents, it is far better to decline your resident’s request. It does not hamper the association formation process in any way, and respects every resident’s privacy, however limited it is today.

1) Right to Pass Through Utilities. If the written rental agreement so provides, the landlord may require residents to pay a utility or service charge that has been billed by a utility or service provider to the resident for utility or service provided directly to the resident’s space.1 Subject to the policies of the utility or service provider, a landlord may, provide for utilities or services to tenants by one or more of the following billing methods:
￼￼
Where there is a relationship between the resident and the provider in which:
 The provider provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space,
including any utility or service line, and bills the tenant directly; and
 The landlord does not act as a provider.
A relationship between the landlord, resident and provider in which:
 The provider provides the utility or service to the landlord;
 The landlord provides the utility or service directly to the resident’s space
(or common area); and
 The landlord:
• Includes the cost of the utility or service in the rent; or
• Bills the resident for the cost separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s
charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter.2 A relationship between the landlord, resident and provider in which:
 The provider provides the utility or service to the landlord;
 The landlord provides the utility or service directly to the resident’s
space; and
 The landlord uses a submeter to measure the utility or service actually
provided to the space and bills the resident for the amount provided.
•
￼1 The landlord is required to disclose to the tenant in writing at or before the commencement of the tenancy, any utility or service that the tenant pays directly to a utility or service provider that benefits, directly, the landlord or other tenants. This refers to common area utilities.
2 The apportionment method is of limited permissibility today.
• Exceptions:
 A landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment to bill
the resident for a utility or service charge separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter for:
• For garbage collection and disposal, unless the pro rata apportionment is based upon the number and size of the garbage receptacles used by the tenant
• For water service, if the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010
• For sewer service, if sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010.
 A landlord and resident may not amend a rental agreement to convert water or sewer utility and service cost in the resident’s rent to a method that bills the resident separately in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter.

2) Notice. To assess a resident for a utility or service charge for any billing period, the landlord shall give them a written notice stating the amount of the utility or service charge that the tenant is to pay the landlord and the due date for making the payment. The due date may not be less than 14 days from the date of service of the notice.

3) Utility or Service Charge is Not Rent or Fee. Nonpayment of a utility or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent, but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause by using a 30-day curable notice of termination.

4) Responsibility. The landlord is responsible for maintaining the utility or service system, including any submeter. After any installation or maintenance of the system on a resident’s space, the landlord shall restore the space to a condition that is the same as or better than the condition of the space before the installation or maintenance.

5) Water. A landlord may not assess a utility or service charge for water unless the water is provided to the landlord by a:
• Public utility as defined in ORS 757.0053;
• Municipal utility operating under ORS chapter 225;
• People’s utility district organized under ORS chapter 261; • Cooperative organized under ORS chapter 62;

"312","312","3","Phil Querin Q&A Tree Outside of MHC Damages House inside MHC","Question: While doing an inspection with my manager, she showed me a large tree branch that had fallen onto a resident’s home in our park.  The issue here is that the tree is located on neighboring land and not in our community.  The resident whose home was damaged had an arborist out to view the tree and said that the tree was a hazard.  What rights and responsibilities do we have in a situation like this?

Answer:   First, this is not an issue that is addressed – or can be addressed – in our “hazard tree” discussions that the MHCO has been having recently in the landlord-tenant coalition meetings.  This tree is not located in the park, so is not strictly a landlord “habitability” issue.  However, under certain circumstances it could be.

Clearly, community management does not have authority to cross over onto another’s land and cut down the tree – or even trim it.  However, if the branches of the tree extend into the community’s airspace, it may legally be trimmed by park management.  If it is feasible to do so, and done in a manner that is safe and responsible, it should be done.  Park management should consult an arborist before proceeding, in order to avoid trimming that could damage or injure the tree itself.  

Additionally, the property owner next door should be notified about the fallen limb.  This is for two reasons: (a) So the owner can secure his/her own expert advice on what to do to the tree to prevent a reoccurrence, and (b) to notify his/her insurance carrier. 

Whether the resident has a claim against the park owner is hard to tell without knowing more.  If the branch extended into the community and was believed to be a potential problem for some time, but ignored by management, then perhaps there is a claim.  But the stronger claim is likely against the owner of the tree itself, especially if it had not been properly cared for as a “hazard tree.”  If a claim is asserted against the park owner, he/she should bring a similar claim against the neighbor whose tree it was.  Then let the insurance carriers work it out.

The 2013 Oregon Legislative Session began earlier this month.   A number of proposals have been introduced that concern the manufactured housing community industry.

Landlord-Tenant Coalition Bill.  MHCO has been negotiating a landlord-tenant coalition bill since the end of the 2011 Legislative Session. In the end MHCO could not reach agreement on “Right of First Refusal” – a delay in the sale of a manufactured home community in order to let residents make an offer to purchase.  This proposal will be introduced as a separate piece of legislation, which MHCO will oppose.

Trees.  The coalition did reach agreement on some adjustment to the maintenance of trees on a space – allowing resident’s to hire a certified arborist to determine if a large tree is a hazard.  The resident has to pay for the initial hire to inspect a tree.  If the tree is deemed to be hazardous then the landlord will be required to pay for necessary maintenance.  Resident’s are still responsible for smaller trees, shrubs, and general space clean up.  A summary of the tree proposal has been prepared by Phil Querin and will be posted here in the next day or two.

MHCO tried to give as little away on this issue as possible, but unfortunately we are not working in a friendly landlord environment in this legislature.  Hence there was a need to make some compromises.

SAFE Act Exemption.  The second issue addressed in the coalition bill is a limited exemption from SAFE for community owners who sell homes in their community.  As currently drafted, community owners would have up to FIVE exemptions from the SAFE Act per year.  This will save close to $1200 per transaction.  MHCO is still working out the final details with the Department of Consumer and Business Services.  Once the law is passed MHCO will provide a complete analysis.

RENT CONTROL. Finally, another Rent Control Bill was introduced in the Senate on Thursday.  This proposal not only addresses rent control, but increases the state enforcement of Oregon Law in your manufactured home community.  This is perhaps one of the more onerous rent control proposals to come along in a couple sessions.  Need less to say MHCO will do everything to defeat this proposal.  

As we move forward this legislative session MHCO will keep you up to date on pending legislative issues.  Working together we are confident that we can defeat “right of first refusal” and rent control and whatever else pops up in the months ahead.

"325","325","1","Phil Querin Analysis of 2013 Legislative Proposal on Trees in Manufactured Home Communities","By  Phillip C. Querin, MHCO Legal Counsel 

Background. Oregon law addresses tenant responsibilities in ORS 90.740.  Currently, subsection (4)(h) says that except as provided in the rental agreement, it is the tenant’s responsibility to “(m)aintain, water and mow or prune any trees, shrubbery or grass on the rented space….”

Generally, most landlords and tenants have regarded this provision as meaning that trees located on a tenant’s space – regardless of size or condition – are the tenant’s sole responsibility. 

However, as a legal matter, notwithstanding the statute, a landlord could still be held liable for poorly maintained or dangerous trees that the landlord knows, or reasonably should know, are potentially dangerous.  While it may not be unreasonable to expect a tenant to engage in routine tree maintenance, e.g. pruning, trimming, watering, etc., it is likely unreasonable for a park owner to expect a tenant to incur the expense or personal safety of trimming or pruning large trees.  [And even if it is not unreasonable, there is legal risk to a landlord who ignores a dangerous tree on a tenant’s space, simply because the tenant has ignored it.]

As a result, MHCO, along with John VanLandingham, and the Landlord-Tenant Coalition, have reached agreement on a compromise bill that allocates responsibility between landlords and tenants for tree maintenance. 

Summary. What follows is a brief summary of the proposed legislation:

•	HABITABILITY
o	A rented space is considered uninhabitable if a landlord fails to maintain a “hazard tree.” 
 

•	DEFINITION OF A “HAZARD TREE”
o	One located on a rented space;
o	Measures at least 8 inches dbh ; and
o	Is considered by an International Society of Arboriculture-certified arborist as posing an unreasonable risk of causing serious physical harm or damage to persons or property in the near future.

•	DEFINITION OF “MAINTAINING” 
o	One that the responsible party (i.e. the landlord of tenant): 
•	Removes, trims or cuts, to eliminate those features of the tree that cause it be hazardous now - or may cause it to be hazardous in the future.  
•	Removing a tree includes cutting it down and removing the trunk, all branches, and the stump. 
o	Removal or major trimming of a tree of greater than 8 inches dbh must be done by a professional, licensed, bonded and insured tree service. 

•	TENANT RESPONSIBILITIES
o	Maintaining, at the tenant’s expense:
•	All non-hazard trees on the tenant’s space, and
•	All hazard trees planted by the tenant. 
o	Tenant maintenance and watering of trees on the rented space includes cleaning up, storing, or removing, any fallen leaves or branches – including hazard trees.
•	LANDLORD RESPONSIBILITIES
o	Unless the tree was planted by the current tenant, the landlord is responsible for maintaining a hazard tree on a rented space if the landlord knows, or should know, that the tree is a hazard tree.
o	A landlord has discretion in deciding whether the appropriate maintenance is removal or trimming of the hazard tree.
o	A landlord is not responsible for tree maintenance:
•	Of non-hazard trees, or
•	Maintaining any trees on the rent space for aesthetic purposes. 
o	A landlord may maintain any tree on a rented space in order to prevent the tree from becoming a hazard tree, after:
•	Providing reasonable written notice to the tenant, and
•	Allowing the tenant a reasonable opportunity to provide the needed maintenance at the tenant’s expense.

•	NOTICE TO TENANT FOR INSPECTION  OR MAINTENANCE 
o	The landlord must comply with the notice provisions of ORS 90.725 before entering a tenant’s space to inspect or maintain any tree.
o	A tenant may not deny a landlord permission to enter the space to inspect a tree, if the landlord:
•	Gives the tenant at least 24 hours’ actual notice, and
•	Inspection is at a reasonable time.
o	For purpose of emergency access to remove or trim a hazard tree (i.e. without giving 24 hours’ notice), an “emergency” includes the risk of serious damage or injury to the premises or persons. 
o	If a landlord has a report from a certified arborist that a tree on the tenant’s space is a hazard tree and must be removed or trimmed in order to remove its hazardous features, but is denied access, the landlord shall not be liable for any damage or injury as a result.

•	ARBORIST REPORTS
o	A tenant may retain, at their own expense, a certified arborist to inspect a tree on the tenant’s space.
o	If the arborist determines that the tree is a hazard, the tenant may either:
•	Remove the tree at the tenant’s expense, after providing the landlord with reasonable written notice of the proposed removal together with a copy of the arborist’s report; or
•	If the tree was not planted by the tenant and is the landlord’s responsibility, require the landlord to maintain the tree.   

•	MOVING OF MANUFACTURED DWELLINGS 
o	If home cannot be removed from a space without first removing or trimming a tree located on the space, the owner of the home may, at their own expense, remove or trim the tree before moving the home, after giving reasonable written notice to the landlord. 

•	MISCELLANEOUS
o	A landlord may unilaterally amend the Rental/Lease Agreement to implement this new tree trimming law.
o	The Statement of Policy shall include the park’s policy regarding the planting of trees on the rented space for a manufactured dwelling.

"331","331","3","Phil Querin Q&A Renting Home & Documentation","Question:     We have several park-owned homes that we rent out.  Can we continue to use the regular MHCO forms that we use for our park residents who own their own homes?

 Answer:   This is a good – and important – question.  Here are some points to always remember:

1.	A resident who is renting the home is not under the manufactured housing section of Oregon’s residential landlord-tenant law (“ORLTA”) which is contained in ORS Chapter 90.  This means that you do not treat non-owner residents the same way you would as if they were renting an apartment or home.  Landlord and tenant rights, duties and remedies are different, depending upon whether the person renting the space also owns the home.

2.	A landlord’s remedies [e.g. for-cause termination, etc.] against a non-owner resident are found in ORS 90.392, 90.394, 90.396, 90.398, 90.403 and 90.405; they are not found in the manufactured housing section of ORLTA, which commences at ORS 90.505.   

3.	Similarly, you do not want to use a standard manufactured dwelling space rental agreement for a non-owner resident.  However, due to the number of park-owned homes, MHCO has developed a space rental agreement for tenants who do not own the home. You should use it.  If you use MHCO’s standard manufactured home space rental agreement for persons owning their home, you will be contractually giving the non-owner resident greater rights than you would otherwise need to do.  For example, the “cure period” for violations is much shorter for non-owner tenants – because they only need to vacate with their personal property.  They do not need to move a home.  If they owned the home, they would have a 30-day right to cure under ORS 90.630.  This means that you will have to use a different, non-MHCO form for rules violations by non-owner tenants. 

4.	However, the eviction process, i.e. the filing and service of an FED Complaint under ORS 105.105, et. seq, is the same.  That is, the process of the “first appearance,” trial settings, etc. is exactly the same. 

5.	Importantly, since the park owns the home, the park is the “landlord.”  This means that it must provide inside the home certain safety measures that ORLTA requires of landlords, such as smoke detectors and [if there is a carbon monoxide source] a carbon monoxide detector.  Some counties require a carbon monoxide detector in all cases, even if there is no carbon monoxide source, e.g. a gas fireplace.  Go to the State Fire Marshall’s site for more information on these important issues.

Five years later the parents vacate the home but leave the boy who is now eighteen.  Even though the eighteen year old was never subject to a background check, never signed a rental agreement etc., is he now a considered a resident?

Answer:  This is an issue that the Oregon Residential Landlord Tenant Act (“ORLTA” or the “Act”) is not fully equipped to address. Nowhere in the Act is there a clear answer.  But connecting some dots, I think we can arrive at a logical answer.  

•	Technically, the 18-year old is not a tenant under the manufactured housing park (“MHP”) side of the Act, since he does not “own” the home.  At best, he is a “tenant” under the non-MHP side of the law – he could be considered a month-to-month tenant, and therefore subject to the 30-day right of termination by the landlord.  Assuming this, what is the landlord to do?  First, do the rules permit subleasing?  If not, he could be compelled to leave. 
•	Second, rent should not be accepted from him until this situation is clarified and a solution reached.
•	Third, if the landlord is willing to accept the 18-year old under these circumstances (i.e. assuming he goes into title), he could be offered a monthly tenancy, subject to his qualifying under the community rules, etc. which, of course, require the background check, etc.  
•	Lastly, again assuming the landlord is willing to accept him, a guarantee by the parents might be in order.  
•	Keep in mind that since he was not a signatory to the original rental agreement since he was a minor, the fact that he is the only person remaining at the home, technically makes him an authorized occupant that has not yet been approved by park management. This is your strongest card, and you should use it to fashion the solution that best fits your needs.

All of these things require some legal guidance, but the answer to the above question is that the landlord, by acting carefully, should be able to protect his position and either require the 18-year old to vacate or qualify in all respects as a new resident (assuming he goes into ownership of the home).  In all cases a background check is not only appropriate, but essential.

We put him under the Occupancy Agreement instead of permitting to become a tenant because his background check was sketchy.  They both work and they alternate paying the monthly rent.  Generally they do not create problems in the community and stay mostly by themselves.  However, recently the tenant and boyfriend broker up, but the tenant moved out leaving her boyfriend to continue paying the rent. How do I get the boyfriend out?

Answer: A temporary occupant is not supposed to be paying the rent.  You are not allowed to screen for the occupant’s ability to pay, because they are not a tenant.  Your acceptance of rent from the occupant creates an appearance that the occupant is really a tenant.  Secondly, the law says that a temporary occupant may not live in the home unless there is a tenant there as well.  Accordingly, if you accept rent from the temporary occupant in the absence of the tenant living there, it could create a situation where you have waived the temporary occupant status, and are now treating him as a full time tenant.
 
Here are the rules under the temporary occupancy statute ORS 90.275:
 
• The temporary occupant:
o Is not a tenant entitled to occupy the dwelling unit to the exclusion of others; and 
o Does not have the rights of a tenant.
• The temporary occupancy agreement may be terminated by:
o The tenant without cause at any time; and
o The landlord only for cause that is a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement.
• The temporary occupant does not have a right to cure a violation that causes a landlord to terminate the temporary occupancy agreement.
• Before entering into a temporary occupancy agreement, a landlord may screen the proposed temporary occupant for issues regarding conduct or for a criminal record. The landlord may not screen the proposed temporary occupant for credit history or income level.
• A temporary occupancy agreement:
o Must expressly include the above requirements;
o May provide that the temporary occupant is required to comply with any applicable rules for the premises; and
o May have a specific ending date.
• The landlord, tenant and temporary occupant may extend or renew a temporary occupancy agreement or may enter into a new temporary occupancy agreement.
• A landlord or tenant is not required to give the temporary occupant written notice of the termination of a temporary occupancy agreement.
• The temporary occupant shall promptly vacate the dwelling unit if a landlord terminates a temporary occupancy agreement for material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement or if the temporary occupancy agreement ends by its terms.
o Except in cases of discrimination (ORS 90.449) a landlord may terminate the tenancy of the tenant if the temporary occupant fails to promptly vacate or if the tenant materially violates the temporary occupancy agreement.
• A temporary occupant is treated as a squatter if they continue to occupy the home after a tenancy has ended or after the tenant revokes permission for the occupancy by terminating the temporary occupancy agreement.
• A landlord may not enter into a temporary occupancy agreement for the purpose of evading landlord responsibilities;
• A tenant may not become a temporary occupant in the tenant’s own dwelling unit;
• A tenancy may not consist solely of a temporary occupancy. Each tenancy must have at least one tenant.
 
In your case, it would appear that you could either terminate the tenant’s tenancy since they vacated leaving the temporary occupant to occupy alone, a violation of the statute, or terminate the temporary occupant for the same reason.  I would try a written notice to the temporary occupant, to see if they will voluntarily vacate.  If they refuse, then you should retain counsel and proceed to evict him as a squatter.  Do not, under any circumstances, accept rent from the temporary occupant.","Question: A tenant has her boyfriend living in her home under a MHCO Occupancy Agreement.",,"1370367280","2"
"341","341","3","Phil Querin Q&A  Converting Water Systems and Billing (Well Water to Public System)","Question:  Our community has been on well water forever. There is a new water system available to hook up to. Under that system each space would have its own meter and a flat rate would be charged for the first fixed number of gallons per space. After the fixed number of gallons/space is used, the homeowner would be charged a price per gallon. Can we charge exactly what the water system charges on top of the current rent?  Effectively passing on what we are charged for their individual use?

Answer:  For purpose of addressing this issue, I will assume that the community currently includes the operating costs for the well in the base rent, i.e. it is not a charge to residents outside of base rent that is allocated to them on a prorata (i.e. per space) basis.

Well water is not something you may separately charge the residents for under ORS 90.532.  There is no recognized method under Oregon law to recover it separately from – or outside of – base rent.  Since base rent may only be increased in accordance with the 90-day rent raise protocol described in ORS 90.600, there is no pass-through alternative for communities serviced by well water for drinking.  Subsection (8) of ORS 90.532 limits utility charges for water through the following means:

A landlord may not assess a utility or service charge for water unless the water is provided to the landlord by a:
      (a) Public utility as defined in ORS 757.005;
      (b) Municipal utility operating under ORS chapter 225;
      (c) People’s utility district organized under ORS chapter 261;
      (d) Cooperative organized under ORS chapter 62;
      (e) Domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264; or
      (f) Water improvement district organized under ORS chapter 552.
      (9) A landlord that provides utilities or services only to tenants of the landlord in compliance with this section and ORS 90.534 and 90.536 is not a public utility for purposes of ORS chapter 757.

Your question does not indicate whether the new water system falls into one of the above categories.  If it does, then you are entitled to assess a pass-through protocol, so long as the other submetering statutes are followed

What follows is brief summary of the applicable statutes.  As you will see, the issues are technical and complex.  In short, you should secure competent legal advice from an expert familiar with your particular situation.  This article or summary should not be relied upon to the exclusion of obtaining that legal advice.

•	90.532 This statute sets forth the permissible billing methods park owners may use for their water charges.

•	90.534 This statute describes how a landlord may charge for providing a utility or service directly to the residents’ spaces by apportionment of the costs per space.
•	90.536 This statute describes the use of submeters to each space and the appropriate billing method.

•	90.537 This statute instructs landlords on how and when they may convert from one billing method to another.

•	90.538 This statute describes the tenants’ rights to inspect billing records when an owner converts from one billing system to another.  In your case, since you are on well water, the only records I imagine you would have would be the well water maintenance costs, since there is no direct water charge to you.
 
•	90.539 This statute describes the park owner’s rights to access a resident’s space to read the submeter.  

Conclusion.  Without knowing more, it is hard to say definitively whether your proposed billing method [assuming the system is permissible under ORS 90.532(8)], would be allowed.  However, my guess is that it is not.  The reason is that the legislation and legislative history that resulted in these statutes is based upon much discussion and anecdotal experience.  The categories and protocols are very specific.  If you were to submeter, I suspect you could not “blend” your charges to include the equivalent of a fixed fee for everyone, with a metered rate for the higher users.  The concept behind submetering is that everyone pays for exactly what they use – no more, no less.  You proposed system does not appear to do that.

Additionally, I do not believe you may “convert” to this new system without making some downward adjustment in base rent, to account for the fact that the residents will no longer be using the well water – and therefore should no longer be paying the well maintenance cost.  [Of course, if the well water were converted to irrigation, that cost – already in the base rent - would seemingly be permissible.]

[Oregon House Bill 3482]

Discussion:  Many manufactured housing communities in Oregon have large trees.  While Oregon law has imposed the duty of general tree maintenance on the residents, there is little question but that most do not have the expertise, skill or financial means to provide the type of maintenance that may be required for large older trees.  With this in mind, the MHCO encouraged the Landlord-Tenant Coalition to craft a bill that fairly and clearly allocated the responsibility for tree maintenance in a realistic manner.  Landlords are in a better position than residents to obtain and afford good liability insurance, since it is a standard cost of doing business.  Moreover, there was concern that under the existing law, some park owners might not regard the issue of tree maintenance as their problem.  In reality, however, it is.  Injury or death resulting from falling limb or tree that should have been trimmed or removed is surely going to result in potential liability to the park owner.  Accordingly, HB 3482 allocates the risk in a more realistic and practical manner:  Normal maintenance for trees on a resident’s space remains with the resident. However, if the tree has certain features that make it a “hazard tree” then responsibility shifts to the landlord – unless the resident planted the tree.  This delineation should help both landlords and residents understand their respective responsibilities.  

1.	Definitions.
•	“DBH”  means  the  diameter at  breast  height,   which is  measured   as the  width of  a standing tree  at  four  and  one-half feet  above  the  ground  on the  uphill side. 
 
•	“Hazard tree”  means  a tree  that:
o	Is located  on a rented space in  a manufactured dwelling park;
o	Measures  at  least  eight  inches  DBH;  and
o	Is  considered, by  an  arborist licensed  as a  landscape  construction professional pursuant  to ORS  671.560 and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture, to pose an unreasonable risk  of causing  serious  physical  harm  or  damage  to individuals or  property in the  near  future.

2.	Habitability.  A rented space is considered uninhabitable if the landlord does not  maintain a hazard tree required by the 2013 Act. 
 
3.	Resident Duties re Trees Located on Space.  A resident  shall maintain and water trees, including cleanup and removal of fallen branches  and leaves, on the  rented space for  a manufactured dwelling except  for  hazard trees. 
•	“Maintaining a  tree”  means removing or  trimming a  tree  for  the  purpose  of eliminating features of the  tree  that  cause the  tree  to  be hazardous, or  that  may  cause  the  tree to become hazardous in  the  near  future. 

•	“Removing a tree”  includes:
o	Felling and  removing the  tree;  and 
o	Grinding or removing the stump of the tree.

4.	Landlord Duties re Hazard Trees. 
•	Landlord shall maintain a hazard tree that  was not  planted by the  current resident if the landlord knows  or should know that  the  tree  is a hazard tree;

•	Landlord may  maintain a tree  on the  rented space to prevent the  tree  from  becoming  a hazard tree;
o	Must provide residents with reasonable written notice and reasonable opportunity to maintain the tree themselves.

•	Landlord has discretion to decide whether the appropriate maintenance of a hazard tree is removal or trimming.

•	Landlord is not responsible for:
o	Maintaining a tree that is not a hazard tree; or
o	Maintaining any tree for aesthetic purposes.

•	A landlord must comply with the access provisions of ORS 90.725 before entering a resident’s space to inspect or maintain a tree. [Generally, 24-hour notice. – PCQ]

•	Subject to the preceding, a resident is responsible for maintaining the non-hazard trees on the resident’s space at the resident’s expense.  
o	The  resident may  retain an  arborist licensed  as a landscape  construction professional pursuant to ORS 671.560 and certified by the International Society  of Arboriculture to inspect a tree  on  the  resident’s  space  at  the  resident’s  expense;
o	If  the  arborist determines that  the  tree  is a hazard, the  resident may:
•	Require the  landlord to  maintain the tree  as a hazard tree;  or
•	Maintain the  tree  at  the  resident’s  expense,  after providing the  landlord with reasonable  written notice  of the  proposed  maintenance and  a copy of the  arborist’s report.

5.	Tree Obstructing Removal of Home From Space. If a manufactured home cannot  be removed  from  a space without first  removing or  trimming a  tree  on  the  space,  the  owner   of  the  home may  remove  or trim the  tree  at  the  owner’s  expense,  after giving  reasonable written  notice  to the landlord, for  the  purpose  of removing the  home.
 
6.	Use  of Landscape Professional.  The  landlord or  resident that   is  responsible  for  maintaining  a  tree   must  engage  a landscape  construction professional with  a  valid  landscape license  issued  pursuant to  ORS  671.560  to maintain any  tree  with a DBH  of eight  inches  or  more.

7.	 Access to Resident’s Space [ORS 90.725].
•	An “emergency” includes  but  is not  limited  to:
o	A repair problem that, unless  remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious  physical  harm  or damage  to individuals or property;
o	The presence of a hazard tree on a rented space in a manufactured dwelling park.

•	An “unreasonable time”  refers  to a time  of day,  day  of the  week  or  particular time  that conflicts  with the  resident’s  reasonable and  specific  plans  to use the  space. 

•	 “Yard   maintenance,  equipment  servicing  or  grounds   keeping” includes,   but  is  not limited to, servicing individual septic  tank  systems or  water pumps,  weeding, mowing grass and  pruning trees  and  shrubs.

•	A  landlord   or  a  landlord’s   agent  may  enter  onto  a  rented  space to:
o	Inspect or  maintain trees;
o	A  landlord or  the  landlord’s agent may  enter  a rented space solely  to  inspect  a tree  despite  a denial of consent  by the  resident if  the  landlord or the  landlord’s agent  has given  at least  24 hours’  actual notice  of the  intent to enter  to inspect  the  tree  and  the  entry occurs  at  a reasonable time. 
o	If a landlord has a report from  an  arborist licensed  as a landscape  construction professional  pursuant to ORS 671.560 and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture that  a tree  on the  rented space is a hazard tree  that  must  be maintained by the  landlord under this Act, the  landlord is not  liable  for  any  damage  or injury as a result  of the  hazard tree  if  the  landlord is unable  to gain  entry after making a good faith effort  to do so.

•	If the  resident  refuses  to  allow  lawful   access, the  landlord   may  obtain  injunctive relief to compel access or may  terminate the  rental  agreement  pursuant to ORS 90.630 
(1) and  take  possession in  accordance with the Oregon eviction statutes. In addition,   the landlord   may recover actual damages.

8.	Statement of Policy.  It shall include the facility policy regarding the planting of trees on the resident’s rented space.  [See ORS 90.510]

"357","357","3","Phil Querin Q&A Resident Builds Carport - Sells Home - New Owner Wants to Take Home and Carport","Question: I have a resident who was given permission to build a permanent carport.  Most all of the carports in my park are free standing and permanent which is my preference. However, he constructed the permanent carport by boring holes in the ground and filling them with concrete and inserting metal mounts to which he fastened 4x4 uprights for the carport.  Building it this way, in my opinion, made it part of the real property.  I was there when construction started but was absent when it was completed. 

What now complicates matters is that he recently decided to sell the manufactured home, including the carport.  This would not have been an issue had the buyer is now planned on moving the home.  I believe that since the carport is now permanently affixed to the ground, it cannot be sold as personal property along with the home.  He also attached the carport to the manufactured home which may complicate things, as well.  What are my rights here?

Answer:  This situation is not directly addressed in the Oregon manufactured housing laws.  First, some general observations: The manufactured housing side of the landlord-tenant law regards the “space” as the “premises.”  For example, a resident in an apartment may not, without landlord permission, intentionally make major structural changes to the interior of the premises. However, most apartments have rules against this, or it is included in the rental agreement. Your space agreement or rules may have similar prohibitions regarding major changes to the space.

In this case, however, you permitted the work to commence.  It is unclear whether you had reviewed any plans, before the work started.  You should have made this a condition of building the carport in the first place.  What about permits?  It is unclear whether they are required in your jurisdiction, but it is something you should always make sure is complied with.  

I am unclear what you mean when you say that other such structures are “free standing and permanent.”  If they are permanent, in the sense of being permanently affixed to the space, then presumably, you are treating these as structures that would remain if the home were sold and removed.  However, your independent conclusion that a structure is “permanent” and therefor stays with the space is really not the complete issue; what does the resident believe?  It was his money that presumably paid for the work, and he may have some say in whether he intended it to be a part of the home, and movable if the time came.  

While your opinion is important, so is that of your resident.  For this reason, I suggest that before doing this again, you might consider addressing it in the community rules.  Some of the things that should be covered are the following:

•	Code compliance
•	Management pre-approval of completed drawings
•	Time to complete work
•	Your right to post a notice of non-responsibility for liens if the resident hires a contractor
•	Method of affixing to the ground
•	Safety of final structure and perhaps inspector sign-off
•	Who owns the structure
•	Can it be removed upon sale and removal of the home (I suggest “yes” so long as the space is returned to its original condition and all holes are safely and completed filled, etc.)
•	Duty to keep the carport in good and safe condition – remember if it is a part of the space, absent agreement with the resident, it would be your duty, since you own the park.
In this particular case, I suggest that if you have not pre-addressed these issues with your resident, he may believe this is his structure to do with as he sees fit.  I really can’t disagree, since you permitted the project and from your question, it appears no ground rules were established regarding ownership in the event the home was moved. However, if you permit the carport structure to be removed, you should insist that the space be returned to its original pre-construction condition.  That’s about the best you can do with this situation, although establishing rules – or at least agreed-upon terms – before construction commences again, is a good idea.

"363","363","3","Phil Querin Q&A Roaches and You!","Question: Community owner owns a home and discovers that the home is infested with roaches.  The community owner blames the resident and hires an exterminator.  Can the exterminator enter the house?  What kind of notice would be required? Can the landlord force the resident to pay for the extermination? 

Answer:  Since the tenant does not own the home, the answer is found on the general landlord-tenant side of ORS Chapter 90 (as opposed to the manufactured housing side).  Here is a summary of the tenant duties under ORS 90.325:

The underscored portion above clearly applies. The next question is the right of access.  That is covered in ORS 90.322.  The statute is quite long and complicated.  Here is a summary of the relevant portions applicable to your situation:

•	A landlord or, to the extent provided in this section, a landlord’s agent may enter into the tenant’s dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under the tenant’s exclusive control in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, perform agreed yard maintenance or grounds keeping or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workers or contractors. The right of access of the landlord or landlord’s agent is limited as follows:
•	In case of an emergency, a landlord may enter the dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant’s exclusive control without consent of the tenant, without notice to the tenant and at any time. “Emergency” includes but is not limited to a repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious damage to the premises. If a landlord makes an emergency entry in the tenant’s absence, the landlord shall give the tenant actual notice within 24 hours after the entry, and the notice shall include the fact of the entry, the date and time of the entry, the nature of the emergency and the names of the persons who entered.
 
•	If the tenant requests repairs or maintenance in writing, the landlord or landlord’s agent, without further notice, may enter upon demand, in the tenant’s absence or without the tenant’s consent, for the purpose of making the requested repairs until the repairs are completed. The tenant’s written request may specify allowable times. Otherwise, the entry must be at a reasonable time. The authorization to enter provided by the tenant’s written request expires after seven days, unless the repairs are in progress and the landlord or landlord’s agent is making a reasonable effort to complete the repairs in a timely manner. If the person entering to do the repairs is not the landlord, upon request of the tenant, the person must show the tenant written evidence from the landlord authorizing that person to act for the landlord in making the repairs.
      
•	A landlord may not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. A tenant may not unreasonably withhold consent from the landlord to enter.

•	If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access or may terminate the rental agreement under ORS 90.392 and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. In addition, the landlord may recover actual damages.

You have two choices in this situation: (a) Declare an emergency and enter to remediate the problem, carefully following the provisions of the access statute; (b) Try to secure the tenant’s consent to have an exterminator enter and remediate the problem; (c) Terminate the tenancy and then fix the problem. Note that if you seek consent and the tenant refuses, you cannot then enter under the emergency provisions of the law, since the tenant has already refused access.

"359","359","1","Legislative Update:  MHCO Pushes Back SAFE Regulations for Oregon Community Owners","OREGON’S SAFE ACT EXEMPTION FOR PARK OWNERS
[Oregon HB 3482 – Landlord-Tenant Coalition Bill]
By Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC MHCO Legal Counsel

Discussion: Manufactured park owners have for several years struggled to keep their communities occupied by owners of homes [as opposed to renters of homes]. Home ownership is good for everyone, and is reflected in better care of the home and space, pride of ownership, and community involvement that does not necessarily occur when homes are filled with renters. For these reasons, many parks require that homes be owner-occupied. Oregon's abandonment law requires that the landlord be primarily responsible for the disposition of abandoned homes. This has placed a significant financial burden, including increased liability, on landlords who are now required to go through the byzantine, costly, and time consuming abandonment process imposed by ORS 90.675, which consists of approximately five pages of statutory procedures - from the mailing of letters to multiple parties, to advertising and conducting a private sale.

In many cases, it is the landlord who ends up being saddled with the home, when there are no higher bidders at the private sale. When they recover possession of homes either though a completed abandonment or through pre-abandonment when the tenant voluntarily waives their right to the home under ORS 90.675(22)(e), landlords are faced with one of two alternatives:

 Give the home away to a charity or non-profit;
 Dismantle and/or remove the home, or
 Sell it to a person who wants to become a resident in the community.
Reselling the home to a potential tenant is clearly the best choice, as it provides an affordable housing option to people who might not otherwise have one. In many cases, tenants cannot afford institutional financing for such a purchase, or the lender will simply not make the loan since it is personal property. Landlord-carried financing provides potential residents with the opportunity to become home owners. Furthermore, purchasing a home may be a tenant’s only chance to live in the community if the rules require owner-occupancy.

Oregon’s Limited Dealer License Law. In order to make these types of on-site sales, park owners must have a dealer’s license under ORS 446.691 or a limited dealer’s license under ORS 446.706. This statute governing limited dealer licenses, which most park owners hold if they are selling formerly abandoned homes, provides the following:

 The home must have been abandoned at a manufactured dwelling park.
 If the home was not subject to sale under the private auction provisions of the abandonment law, the dealer must have the certificate of title or registration for
the dwelling transferred to them before offering it for sale; or 1
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
 The home must have been purchased by the park owner from a person holding title, and at the time of purchase by the park owner, it was sited in the community identified in the park owner’s license.
 If the park owner sells the home that was abandoned at a park other than the park where it is being sold, the sale terms must require that it be sited at the park where it is being sold for at least 12 months following the sale.

The limited license arose out of the need for park owners to legally make the occasional sale of abandoned or pre-abandoned homes in order to keep in [or bring into] the community. The limited license requirement provides DCBS regulatory oversight, and is not an unduly burdensome requirement for park owners.

The SAFE Act’s Regulatory Scheme. Since the enactment of the federal SAFE Act and its Oregon counterpart found in ORS Chapter 86A, the Oregon Division of Finance and Corporate Securities (“DFCS”) has interpreted these laws to apply to the occasional on-site sales by park owners under their limited licenses. They have reached this conclusion primarily because there is ostensibly a ""credit decision"" made by the park owner when entering into an installment contract sale with a tenant. This means that under Oregon law, park owners operating under a limited license had one of two choices:

 Either become licensed as a Mortgage Broker or Mortgage Loan Originator (""MLO""); or
 Contract with an existing MLO who works for an independent Mortgage Broker - at a reported cost of $1,400+ or more to the park owner, and ultimately to the home buyer.
The New Statutory Exemption. MHCO worked extensively with DFCS and others to develop an exemption to the Oregon law that would permit park owners to engage in the sale of formerly abandoned homes to purchasers for the purpose of a primary residence without having to use a MLO. Here is a summary of the new exemption law which will be found in ORS 86A.203. It applies to:

• One who is licensed as a manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.691.
o May offer or negotiate terms of a residential mortgage loan related to a sale for occupancy of a previously owned manufactured dwelling in a park, three or fewer
times in a 12 month period;
o A written sale agreement must be used that complies with certain requirements, or
with DFCS rules1.
o The person may not hold more than eight residential mortgage loans without
securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1). [Presumably, this means “at one time.”]
1 The statute cited to for compliance, ORS 646A.052, et. seq. is antiquated and inadequate for residential housing today. Presumably, the DFCS will have to create a suitable form through rulemaking.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼2
• One who is licensed as a limited manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.706.
o May offer or negotiate terms of a residential mortgage loan related to a sale for occupancy of a previously owned manufactured dwelling in a park, five or fewer
times in a 12 month period:
o They must have an ownership interest in a manufactured dwelling park;
o A written sale agreement must be used that complies with certain requirements, or
with DFCS rules.
o The person may not hold more than twelve residential mortgage loans without
securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1). [Presumably, this means “at one time.”]

"377","377","3","Phil Querin Q&A Home Reseller Paying Fees to Employees of Another Company","Question: Is it legal for a manufactured home reseller to pay referral fees to employees of another company who are not working under the reseller’s specific dealers license?


Answer: I cannot find any law precisely on point, so will have to “reason by analogy.” For purposes of answering the question, I will assume that the payor and the payee both have an Oregon manufactured structures dealer’s (“MSD”) license. However, that license only permits one to conduct business from a single location. If a person wanted to conduct business elsewhere, they would need to have a supplemental license (Form 440-2963).  See, statutes here. 

My concern with the payment of referral fees between separate dealers, is that it blurs the distinction between the “single location” requirement.  In other words, the payee would be receiving compensation from his own business location and another (unrelated) business location as well.  I would not be too concerned if the two locations where owned by the same person or entity, but if not, there could be regulatory problems with the responsible agency, Finance & Corporate Securities Division (“DFCS”).

Legally, there could  be additional ramifications.  Say the recipient of the fee made a misrepresentation to the customer, or there was a material defect in the home that resulted in injuries. If litigation ensued, the plaintiff would have two potential targets rather than one.  

Under the Oregon real estate licensing laws, one broker may pay a referral fee to another broker associated with an unrelated company.  However, this is expressly permitted by statute.  I see nothing in the statutes allowing MSDs to engage in referral fee activity, so would not recommend it without first checking with the DFCS.

It appears the ground underneath her mobile is settling and the concrete pad has cracked.  She indicated that she is worried about the water lines to her home.  She has lived in the park for 30 years, and is a former manager approaching 80 years of age. What is my responsibility for leveling mobile homes in the park, even if caused by the ground subsiding? 


Answer: Normally, per the park rules, leveling is a resident responsibility at the commencement of the tenancy. However, here you may have a habitability issue.  Here is what the statute says:

90.730 (Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition.) provides: 
      (2) A landlord who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home shall at all times during the tenancy maintain the rented space, vacant spaces in the facility and the facility common areas in a habitable condition. The landlord does not have a duty to maintain a dwelling or home. A landlord’s habitability duty under this section includes only the matters described in subsections (3) to (5) of this section.
      (3) For purposes of this section, a rented space is considered unhabitable if it substantially lacks:
      (e) At the time of commencement of the rental agreement, buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin;”

This would seem to suggest that from a habitability standpoint, as long as the pad was in good shape at the commencement of the tenancy, you no longer have any further duty to the resident. I think that conclusion would be a mistake. 

By your question, it sounds as if your elderly resident is concerned about her water lines.  Leveling it could prevent this damage.  If the condition of the pad was due to the resident’s improper use, that’s one thing.  But here, it’s due to the condition of the ground that you rented to her.  She has no right to “fix” the ground as it’s not hers to fix. 

Inasmuch as you own the ground, and the ground is causing the problem, I would suggest that leveling is your responsibility.  If the problem was not the result of the ground, I would say it is the resident’s responsibility.  Look at it this way:  If you do nothing, and her water lines break, she will have a damage claim against you.  If you level it, that risk is greatly reduced if not eliminated. If you do pay to the have leveling done, make sure that someone checks the water lines under the home, just to make sure they have not been damaged by the cracking in the pad.  

There is a greater question as to whether the pad itself needs to be fixed.  Leveling the home may be just a temporary fix if the problem continues.

What Can Be Done To Prevent This?","Question: A tenant was convicted of a sex crime - molesting his granddaughters.  He will be released from jail shortly.  His wife is living in our community, but her name is not on the rental agreement, just her husband's. His intentions are to resume living with his wife in our 55+ Park.  What can we do to prevent his return?

Answer: I assume when he was first accepted as a resident he did not have a criminal record for any sex offenses. The statute that comes into play is ORS 90.630 (Termination by landlord; causes; notice; cure; repeated nonpayment of rent.)  It provides, in part: 

“ ... the landlord may terminate a rental agreement that is a month-to-month or fixed term tenancy for space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home by giving to the tenant not less than 30 days’ notice in writing before the date designated in the notice for termination if the tenant:
      (c) Is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587;”

This statute has only been in existence for a few years.  As I read it, assuming that at the commencement of the tenancy, a landlord ran a criminal background check on a prospective resident and nothing showed him to be a sex offender – and they he later committed a sexual offence – you can evict them at as soon as you find out.  

In this case, it would seem that you can exclude him on that basis alone.  Had this law been on the books when he committed the crime, and he didn’t go to jail, you could have evicted him at the time. Now that it’s on the books, I think you have the same right to keep him out, i.e. to protect the residents’ visiting grandchildren.     

The only issue is whether he is “…a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587.”    Here is what those statutes say, and I imagine you will have to verify whether he falls into one of the categories.    

181.585 “Predatory sex offender” defined; determination. (1) For purposes of ORS 181.585 to 181.587, a person is a predatory sex offender if the person exhibits characteristics showing a tendency to victimize or injure others and has been convicted of a sex crime listed in ORS 181.594 (5)(a) to (d), has been convicted of attempting to commit one of those crimes or has been found guilty except for insanity of one of those crimes.

      (B) Shall notify a long term care facility, as defined in ORS 442.015, or a residential care facility, as defined in ORS 443.400, that the person is a predatory sex offender if the agency knows that the person is seeking admission to the facility.

      (b) Is neglecting to take treatment or participate in rehabilitation. [Formerly 181.509]


MHCO Note:  The law regarding the eviction of sexual predators was championed by MHCO several years ago.  Through MHCO's efforts in the Landlord-Tenant Coalition, MHCO was able to change Oregon Statutes to give Landlords in manufactured home communities the right to evict an existing resident in a community who is discovered to be a predatory sex offender.

"402","402","3","Phil Querin Q&A Accepting Application When You Suspect Applicant Does Not Qualify.","Question: I recently received a rental application from a prospective tenant who is purchasing another tenant's home.  I know the applicant to have several judgments against him.  He says they have all been taken care of but I don't believe him.  I really don't want to spend time processing the application.  Do I have to accept and process the application? 

Answer:   A judgment is a lien on all real property that is owned by the judgment debtor in the county in which the debtor resides.  The lien gives the judgment creditor the right to “execute” on that real property, i.e. force a sale of the property with the proceeds being applied toward payment of the judgment. It is good for ten years and can be renewed for another ten years.  If the creditor doesn’t know if the debtor owns property in a particular county he can record the judgment there anyway (or some counties or every county in Oregon), and it will immediately attach if property is located there. This means that if the debtor attempts to dispose of, or mortgage, the property, the  judgment lien will prevent the transaction until the creditor is paid in full.  Judgments carry interest at 9% per annum. 

If the judgment debtor does not own any real property to which the lien can attach, he can still try to get paid, either through garnishment of wages or bank accounts, or execution upon other of the debtor’s assets. If the creditor doesn’t know what assets the debtor has, he can subpoena him into court, place him under oath, and ask questions about the existence and whereabouts of the debtor’s assets.

As you can see, armed with a recorded judgment, a creditor can make a debtor’s life somewhat unpleasant. Once the judgment is satisfied, the debtor should insist that the creditor remove the lien by recording a Satisfaction of Judgment.  This has the effect of nullifying the judgment and it will no longer appear as a negative comment on his credit history.  

In your case, you should tell the person that as long as the judgments appear on the record, it will appear on his credit report, affect his credit score,  and could interfere with his ability to qualify to rent a space in your community. If,  indeed, the liens have been taken care of, he needs to have the judgment creditors each record a Satisfaction of Judgment. 

A word of caution: ORS 90.680(6)(b) says that a landlord may not unreasonably reject a tenant’s prospective purchaser.  My concern here is that if you reject the purchaser before running the background check, you face a potential claim from the existing tenant that your rejection in advance, was per se´ unreasonable. Furthermore, if the applicant is a member of a protected class, you could be setting yourself up for a fair housing claim. 

Please consider this:  If these are old judgments or very small amounts, they may say little about his qualifications as a tenant.  It may be that no collection efforts are being made. Most collection agencies do not want to spend a lot of time chasing small sums, or if they do, they will discount the amount for a cash payment. How recent are the judgments? Is he gainfully employed? How long has he been employed?  What is his debt-to-income ratio?  His rental history?  How is he paying for the home?  If you don’t know the answer to these questions, perhaps you should consider running the report just to find out. Since he is paying the cost of the credit check, completing the process may be your best and safest course of action, rather than “assuming” it’s as bad as you think because of the unsatisfied judgments.  It is far easier to say “No” after the credit, criminal, and background checks, because – if you’re right – you’ll have something to base the rejection on.  Rejecting him in advance gives you no such safe harbor protection.

Can you explain the new law?","Question: I understand that today I may sell a home our park acquired back in an abandonment without having to hire a mortgage broker. Can you explain the new law?

Answer:  I assume you are referring to a sale where you carry back the security obligation (as opposed to the buyer paying cash or securing third party financing).  In this respect, you are correct, subject to several limitations. MHCO worked extensively with the Oregon Department of Finance and Corporate Securities (“DFCS”) and others to develop an exemption to the Oregon law that would permit park owners to engage in the sale of formerly abandoned homes to purchasers for the purpose of a primary residence without having to use a broker (referred to as a “Mortgage Loan Originator” or “MLO” under the new law).  Here is a summary of the new exemption law which will be found in ORS 86A.203.  

•	Here are the rules for those licensed as a manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.691.
o	They may offer or negotiate the terms of the loan three or fewer times in a 12 month period;
o	They must use a written sale agreement that complies with certain requirements, or with DFCS rules .
o	The dealer may not hold more than eight residential mortgage loans without securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1). [Presumably, this means “at one time.”] 

•	Here are the rules for those licensed as a limited manufactured structure dealer under ORS 446.706.
o	They may offer or negotiate terms of the loan five or fewer times in a 12 month period:
o	They must have an ownership interest in a manufactured dwelling park; 
o	They must use a written sale agreement that complies with certain requirements, or with DFCS rules.
o	They may not hold more than twelve residential mortgage loans without securing a MLO license under ORS 86A.203(1).  [Presumably, this means “at one time.”]

But here’s the rest of the story: Just because you are exempted from the MLO licensing requirements for a limited number of sales, does not mean that you are free from the tentacles of the Dodd-Frank Act. No, indeed.  In fact, there are two new rules that still will apply. 
1.	Ability-to-Repay (“ATR”) Rules.  A creditor is prohibited from making a residential loan (this includes your sale of the formerly abandoned home) unless it first makes “…a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for “qualified mortgages.” [See CFPB Summary, here.]

In complying with the ATR rules, you must consider and verify the following borrower information:
a)	Current or reasonably expected income or assets [other than the value of the home that secures the loan];
b)	Current employment status;
c)	Monthly payment on the mortgage loan;
d)	Monthly payment on any simultaneous mortgage loan that the creditor knows or has reason to know will be made;
e)	Monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations [e.g., insurance, taxes, assessments];
f)	Current debt obligations;
g)	Monthly debt-to-income ratio, or residual income; and
h)	Credit history.

In making the loan you will be required to calculate the mortgage loan payment based on:
•	The fully indexed rate or any introductory interest rate (whichever is greater); and
•	Substantially equal monthly installment that will fully amortize the loan amount over the loan term.

At first blush, perhaps these requirements don’t seem so burdensome, since one would think any smart lender would follow these protocols anyway. But remember, back in the easy money days, lenders were not keeping most of their loans on their own books; instead, the loans were “securitized”, i.e. bundled and sold as securities to investors all over the world.  This meant that circa 2004 – 2008, the originating banks that funded these residential loans were quickly repaid by investors and were never going to have to deal with them if and when they failed. Hence, bank underwriting was virtually nonexistent back then – except, of course, for those loans the banks were going to keep on their own books (sometimes referred to as ""portfolio loans"").

2.	Qualified Mortgages.  The Dodd-Frank Act has established a term, “Qualified Mortgage,” or “QM,” that provides a safe harbor for lenders.  That is, if the loan is a QM, there is a legal presumption that the lender complied with the ATR underwriting rules, and therefore the penalties for non-compliance are either eliminated or substantially reduced, as discussed below.  If a presumption is “conclusive,” no amount of evidence to the contrary will defeat it.  But if a presumption is “rebuttable,” the party opposing the presumption has an opportunity to rebut it by introducing evidence to the contrary.

For a mortgage to be a “Qualified Mortgage,” it must meet the following requirements:
•	All of the “Non-Traditional” Loan Features Must be Removed – This refers to features that we saw in the past, e.g. negative amortization, interest-only payments, and certain balloon payments.[5]
•	The loan may not exceed 30 years.
•	If the loan is for $100,000 or more, it cannot have points or fees greater than 3% of the total loan amount.  There are different and stricter limits for smaller loans. Certain “bona fide discount points” for prime loans are not included in these limits.
•	There is an Income Verification and Monthly Debt-to-Income Ratio Cap; The borrower’s total monthly debt-to-income ratio (i.e. all housing and non-housing expenses, such as food, automobile, child care, etc.) can be no greater than 43%. 
•	Monthly payments must be based on the highest payment that will apply during the first five years of the loan.
The presumptions afforded to lenders making QM loans gives lender protection as follows:
•	Safe Harbor QM loans – Conclusive Presumption. These are prime loans that (a) Meet the ATR compliance rules including the underwriting requirements above; (b) Are secured by a first lien on the residence; and (c) Carry an interest rate that is less than 1.5% higher than the average prime rate available.[7] The presumption of ATR compliance is conclusive. It is a complete safe harbor.
•	Higher-Priced QM Loans – Rebuttable Presumption. Here, the presumption of ATR compliance is rebuttable. These loans include first-position liens with an interest rate of equal to or greater than 1.5% over the available prime rate.  Essentially, these loans are “higher priced” because the borrowers’ credit is less than prime, i.e. the loan is, in the vernacular, “sub-prime.”

Noncompliance with the ATR Rules. Violations of the ATR rules are harsh, and likely to stifle any types of loans that hint of non-compliance. If a material violation is established, the borrower would have the ability to recover back all of the finance charges and fees paid, plus actual damages, statutory damages, attorney fees and court costs.  The plaintiff’s bar and the class action bar must be sharpening their knives. There is a three year statute of limitations from the date the violation occurred. 

Conclusion.  I marvel at the complexity of these laws which have been implemented to “protect” consumers by confusing creditors – especially small creditors, such as park owners selling formerly abandoned homes to fill a space and provide affordable housing.  If these small transactions caused the credit and housing crisis of 2008 and the ensuing Great Recession, perhaps I could understand.  But they didn’t. What we’re are seeing is a huge net of bureaucratic regulation that has been cast over even the smallest of transactions under the guise of consumer protection.

Going forward into 2014, my suggestion is for park owners to decide if: (a) They want to handle these transactions without the use of a MLO (which will add several hundred dollars to each sale) or (b) Go it alone, with knowledge that they will still be expected to comply with the ATR and QM rules. If the latter, my suggestion is to create the simplest of paper transactions, with a market rate interest, no adjustable rates, and a balloon that is not less than five years.

He met our screening criteria and we sent a letter indicating that he had been accepted.  The applicant lives out of town and started sending rent checks but did not sign the rental agreement.  There were also repairs that we indicated to him that he needed to make before he could move in.  At this point he has title to the home, refuses to sign the rental agreement and we refuse to cash his checks.  What should we do?


Answer:   First and foremost, send the checks back as soon as they come in.  Do not hold onto them, as there is Oregon case law saying that doing so for an unreasonable amount of time can constitute acceptance.  Include a letter with the checks reiterating what you told him about the necessity of the repairs and the need to sign the rental agreement.  I hope the nature of the repairs and the amount of time he has to complete them are a part of the rental agreement.  IF not they should be.  The only real way to enforce this requirement is to make the repairs a written condition of the tenancy.   Do not accept any rent from him unless and until the tenant has signed the rental agreement and it contains an explicit description of the work he is to do and a completion date. 

If he takes possession without having signed a written rental agreement, you may give him a 24-hour notice to terminate under ORS 90.403.  The statute contemplates an improper subleasing arrangement which is not the case here.  However, in all respects, it should work, since his possession is unauthorized and in possession without a signed rental agreement.  Make sure that you use the proper form of notice, as this is not the same situation as giving a 24-hour notice for outrageous conduct under ORS 90.396.  Alternatively, if you have rules in the community that prohibit occupancy without a written rental agreement, you could issue a 30-day notice under ORS 90.630(1)(b).  That way, if he cured by signing the rental agreement (with the repair provision in it) he could stay.  This second alternative, though more time consuming, gives him a chance to come into compliance before having to vacate.

"404","404","3","Phil Querin Q&A Applicant Pays Application Fee - Can Landlord Also Charge a Move-In Fee?","Question: I am confused about all the rules regarding applicants for tenancy.  For example, after an applicant is charged an application fee, has been accepted and is about to move in to the home, does the landlord have the right to charge the new resident a ""move-in"" fee?

Answer:  This question involves 90.297,  which provides as follows: 
•	Except as permitted in ORS 90.295 (fees for tenant screening charges) a landlord may not charge a deposit or fee, however designated, to an applicant who has applied to a landlord to enter a rental agreement for a dwelling unit. 
•	A landlord may charge a deposit, however designated, to an applicant for the purpose of:
o	Securing the execution of a rental agreement, after approving the applicant’s application but prior to entering into a rental agreement.
o	Is so, the landlord must give the applicant a written statement describing:
•	 The amount of rent and the fees the landlord will charge and the deposits the landlord will require; and 
•	The terms of the agreement to execute a rental agreement and the conditions for refunding or retaining the deposit.
•	 If a rental agreement is executed, the landlord shall either apply the deposit toward the moneys due the landlord under the rental agreement or refund it immediately to the tenant. 
•	If a rental agreement is not executed due to a failure by the applicant to comply with the agreement to execute, the landlord may retain the deposit.
•	If a rental agreement is not executed due to a failure by the landlord to comply with the agreement to execute, within four days the landlord shall return the deposit to the applicant either by making the deposit available to the applicant at the landlord’s customary place of business or by mailing the deposit by first class mail to the applicant.
•	If a landlord fails to comply with these rules, the applicant or tenant, as the case may be, may recover from the landlord the amount of any fee or deposit charged, plus $150. 

Based upon the above, it is my opinion that it would be improper to charge a “move-in fee,” unless it was designed to secure the execution of the rental agreement before the applicant took occupancy.  If the rental agreement is already signed, there is nothing to “secure” and the fee would be inappropriate.

"405","405","3","Phil Querin Q&A What access to documents and office do I have to provide to Oregon Housing and Community Services?","Question: What records are we obligated to share with state government officials?  Recently representatives of Oregon Housing and Community Services (“OHCS”) were at the community and stopped by the office.  They started asking for documents, copies of forms etc.  What are my rights as a manager or community owner when it comes to these types of situations?

Answer:    Normally, I don’t like to equivocate, but here, I’m going to have to do so.  I suspect this answer might be quoted to the OHCS as a reason for declining to cooperate, so want to be careful how I answer.  So rather than give a definitive “Yes” or “No” I’m going to give you some things to think about, before turning over documents to anyone other than a bona fide applicant who wants to rent a space.

1.	Ask yourself: “How am I benefited by turning over my documents and forms?”  From where I sit, I see no benefit.  OHCS is not applying for tenancy.  If they can explain to you what good comes to your park by turning over forms that you or MHCO paid to have developed, I might change my mind.
 
2.	Ask yourself: “What can they do if I decline?”  OHCS describes its services and functions as follows:

“Oregon Housing and Community Services is Oregon's housing finance agency, providing financial and program support to create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income. 
  
The current agency was created in 1991, when the legislature merged the Oregon Housing Agency with State Community Services. The coordination between housing and services creates a continuum of programs that can assist and empower lower-income individuals and families in their efforts to become self-reliant. 
  
OHCS administers federal and state antipoverty, homeless and energy assistance, and community service programs. 
  
OHCS also assists in the financing of single-family homes, the new construction or rehabilitation of multifamily affordable housing developments, as well as grants and tax credits to promote affordable housing.” 

These are all worthwhile and laudable goals.  But I don’t see anything on their website [here] suggesting that they are an enforcement or regulatory agency.  So, it appears that a polite refusal to share the forms and other documents you use to operate your community will not be met by any sanction. If they can explain to you what they will do if your refuse to cooperate, and it appears they could visit upon you and your community a parade of unpleasant horribles, I might change my mind.

3.	Ask yourself: “Well, if they are not a regulatory or enforcement agency, can there be any harm in cooperating?”  In looking at their website, it is clear that part of their mission is to: “…create and preserve opportunities for quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income.”  Oregon law protects against discrimination in the sale, leasing or renting of housing, bases upon “source of income.”  [See, ORS 459A.421.] 

Today, there is a case pending before the United States Supreme Court,  which will address whether discrimination arising from “disparate impact” is a violation of the Fair Housing laws. What is “disparate impact?” It means that you, as a landlord or manager, can be held to have discriminated against a member of a protected class – not because of any intent to do so – but merely because your rules, policies, or procedures in the application process, affect them more harshly than other people not in the class.  

It is clear from their website and stated mission, that fair housing is an important issue with the folks at OHCS. That’s a good thing. But my mission is to protect – through education – MHCO’s members with good risk management procedures.  My experience has been that most alleged violations of fair housing laws are inadvertent, sometimes through the use of testers.  That being the case, my concern in voluntarily turning over forms and documents used in managing your community, someone at OHCS might see a policy, rule, or screening criteria, that they interpret as a per se’ violation of state, federal, county or city housing laws. [To put a fine point on this, go to the Fair Housing Council of Oregon’s chart here, identifying the plethora of laws you are already expected to comply with, depending on the location of your community.] 

While I do not see that OHCS could do anything to you if they saw a potential violation, I certainly could see the documents, or information gleaned from them, being turned over to private or public entities that could do something, either through civil action or regulatory action.  

So, if OHCS can explain to you (a) why they need the information; (b) what they would do if they did see something they didn’t like; and (c) what assurances they can give you that they will not turn the documents or information over to a third party for some sort of enforcement action. It they can provide you with such assurances, I might change my mind.

As I have said above, OHCS’s aspirational goals are laudable, and we should have no issue with them. If you want to assist in those goals, you should financially contribute to their cause. But you must also be prudent in your management decisions, balancing the risks versus the benefits, of cooperation.  I see no benefits, but I do see great risks.

"407","407","3","Phil Querin Q&A Resident Growing Marijuana Plants","Question: While working on another house in the community the manager discovered that the neighbor had a large garden of marijuana plants.  The resident claims to have a medical marijuana card.   What are my rights as a community owner?  Can I ask to see the card?  Does the card have to be current?  If he has a medical marijuana card what are my rights?  If he DOES NOT have a medical marijuana card what are my rights?  Finally, the smell from these plants is very pungent and other residents are complaining about the smell.  Can I give the resident who is growing the marijuana a 30 day notice for disturbing the peaceful enjoyment of other residents due to the odor?


Answer:  This is a very complicated issue on several levels.  For example, marijuana is a controlled substance under Federal Law.  Under Oregon law, use and cultivation in limited amounts pursuant to a lawful Medical Marijuana Card are legal.   The Oregon laws are linked here. The statutes cover such things as grow-site registration; medical uses for marijuana; issuance of an identification card; and limitations on a cardholder’s immunity from criminal laws involving marijuana.  For those interested, these statutes should be consulted.  

You have a responsibility to make sure that laws are not being violated in the community. You also have a responsibility to the rest of the other residents. Compliance with all laws is a condition of occupancy under the park’s rental agreement, its rules, and the Oregon Residential Landlord-Tenant Act.  I know of no way you can honor your obligations except to ask to see the card and verify that it is current and held in the name of the resident.    

The main issue here is Fair Housing Laws.  If the resident has a valid card, then arguably he have some medical condition that has authorized its issuance.  Does he have a legal right to demand that under the Fair Housing Laws, you make a “reasonable accommodation” for his medical condition, and permit him to continue in his grow operation?   Not necessarily.  

In January 20, 2011, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) issued a Memorandum, the subject of which was “Medical Use of Marijuana and Reasonable Accommodation in Federal Public and Assisted Housing.” While the Memo was limited to federal public and assisted housing, it can be regarded as a helpful – though perhaps not a “final” resource - on the issue.   It is very complete and helpful for all park managers and owners. It can be downloaded at: https://www.google.com/search?q=hud%20medical%20marijuana.



Here is what the Memo directs:

Public housing agencies “…in states that have enacted laws legalizing the use of medical marijuana must therefore establish a standard and adopt written policy regarding whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance for residents who are medical marijuana users.  The decision of whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance to medical marijuana users is the responsibility of PHAs, not of the Department.” 

Thus, HUD seems to be skirting the issue, leaving it up to the agency in the state that permits the use of medical marijuana.  Between the lines, it appears that HUD will not enforce a fair housing reasonable accommodation claim against park ownership or management if the community has an anti-marijuana policy in place.  Without such a policy, my inclination is that enforcement would be potentially riskier, since the card-holder was not aware of the limitation at the inception of the tenancy.  

In answer to your specific questions:
•	Clearly, the card has to be valid and current in Oregon.  A California card, for example would not suffice.  (See, State v. Berrenger, 2010).
•	If there is no card, or no current valid card, the growing (not use) of marijuana could be is a violation of state law.  You may not be able to issue a 24-hour notice under ORS 90.396, since possession of certain amounts of marijuana pursuant to a valid card, is protected.  However, you may consider issuances of a curable 30-day notice under ORS 90.630;
•	If others are complaining about the odor, you have an issue between enforcing the use and enjoyment provisions of your rules or ORS 90.740(4)(i) versus permitting the activity if the resident has a lawfully issued Oregon card and is not growing over the proscribed amount.

In any event, I would recommend that your community institute a medical marijuana use policy as a part of your rules and regulations.  See, ORS 90.610 for the law regarding rule changes.  Note that the right to implement a rule change – even if it results and a material change to the tenant’s bargain with the park – is expressly permitted.  In other words, you may want to proscribe ALL such activity, even if it pre-existed the new rule.  Alternatively, you could grandfather in current card-holders.

The occupant has been in the house since the beginning of January, and pays his rent on time.  Although he was asked to complete and submit a criminal background check, he still has not done so. Accordingly, we have not given him a written rental agreement to sign.  What are our rights at this point in time?
 
Answer: There are several issues here.  One, you’ve accepted rent from the occupant for the last several months.  For all intents and purposes, you have accepted him as a tenant – even though he is not there on a written rental agreement and even though you have no criminal background check on him.  Even if your rules prohibit subleasing, that too, has been waived.  In other words, all of the breaches you could have enforced against him and/or the tenants who subleased, have been waived and are now unenforceable.
 
Here are the rules on waiver that apply in this situation [ORS 90.412].  While they are of no help in this situation, they may be helpful in the future.
 
A landlord waives the right to terminate a rental agreement for a particular violation of the rental agreement or of law if the landlord:
• During three or more separate rental periods, accepts rent with knowledge of the violation by the tenant; or
• Accepts performance by a tenant that varies from the terms of the rental agreement.
• A landlord has not accepted rent for purposes of subsection (2) of this section if:
o Within 10 days after receipt of the rent payment, the landlord refunds the rent; or 
o The rent payment is made in the form of a check that is dishonored. 
• A landlord does not waive the right to terminate a rental agreement for a violation under any of the following circumstances: 
o The landlord and tenant agree otherwise after the violation has occurred.
o The violation concerns the tenant’s conduct and, following the violation but prior to acceptance of rent for three rental periods or performance, the landlord gives a written warning notice to the tenant regarding the violation that:
• Describes specifically the conduct that constitutes the violation, either as a separate and distinct violation, a series or group of violations or a continuous or ongoing violation;
• States that the tenant is required to discontinue the conduct or correct the violation; and
• States that a reoccurrence of the conduct that constitutes a violation may result in a termination of the tenancy pursuant to ORS 90.392, 90.398, 90.405 or 90.630.
o The tenancy consists of rented space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home, and the violation concerns:
• Disrepair or deterioration of the manufactured dwelling or floating home;
• A failure to maintain the rented space;
• The termination is under ORS 90.396 [24-hour notices].
o The landlord accepts:
• A last month’s rent deposit collected at the beginning of the tenancy, regardless of whether the deposit covers a period beyond a termination date;
• Rent distributed pursuant to a court order releasing money paid into court; or
• Rent paid for a rent obligation not yet due and paid more than one rental period in advance.
• For a continuous or ongoing violation, the landlord’s written warning notice remains effective for 12 months and may be renewed with a new warning notice before the end of the 12 months. 
• A landlord that must refund rent shall make the refund to the tenant or other payer by personal delivery or first class mail. The refund may be in the form of the tenant’s or other payer’s check or in any other form of check or money.
 
The most important thing you should do at this point is to try to determine if this occupant is a sexual predator.   Oregon laws were revised a few years ago to provide that if an occupant is determined to be a predatory sex offender under ORS 181.585 to 181.587, you may unilaterally issue him a 30-day notice to vacate.

Background. The National Flood Insurance Program (“the Program”) was created by Congress in 1968 to mitigate the financial impact of floods on residents and communities. It also encouraged smarter planning choices [and discouraged some development] in areas with an unacceptable risk of flooding. The NFIP is controlled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”). 

Financial History of the Program.  Historically the Program has not been run in a prudent financial manner. From its inception in 1968 to the present, Congress has failed to pass legislation to address problems within the program, instead choosing to pass multiple extensions.  With losses estimated in the billions of dollars after severe flooding events such as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Irene, and more recently, Sandy, the Program’s resources have become depleted.  According to the Government Accounting Office (“GAO”): 

""The potential losses generated by NFIP have created substantial financial exposure for the federal government and U.S. taxpayers. While Congress and FEMA intended that NFIP be funded with premiums collected from policyholders and not with tax dollars, the program was, by design, not actuarially sound. As of November 2012, FEMA owes the Treasury approximately $20 billion, up from $17.8 billion pre-Sandy, and had not repaid any principal on the loan since 2010."" 

In January 2013, Congress passed legislation to temporarily increase NFIP’s borrowing authority to $30.4 billion. 

Oregon Landlord-Tenant Law.  ORS 90.228 (Notice of location in 100-year flood plain) provides as follows:

 (1) As used in this section, “100-year flood plain” means the level that flood waters may be expected to equal or exceed once each 100 years, as determined by the National Flood Insurance Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) If a dwelling unit is located in a 100-year flood plain, the landlord shall provide notice in the dwelling unit rental agreement that the dwelling unit is located within the flood plain.
(3) If a landlord fails to provide a notice required under this section, and the tenant of the dwelling unit suffers an uninsured loss due to flooding, the tenant may recover from the landlord the lesser of the actual damages for the uninsured loss or two months’ rent. [2009 c.306 §2]
 
Does ORS 90.228 apply to manufactured housing parks?  It appears so, since the definition of a “dwelling unit” means not only a residential rental structure, but also “…a space for a manufactured dwelling or recreational vehicle *** and not the manufactured dwelling….” See, ORS 90.100(11)

Accordingly, park owners in or near flood zones need to give the required “100-year flood plain” notice to their residents. In addition, a new law known as the “Biggert-Waters Insurance Reform Act of 2012,” is going to create two new headaches for park owners located in or near flood zones.

Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (“the Act”). Although the Act became effective on July 6, 2012, there has been relatively little attention given to the new law until now. 

Problem No. One (The Subsidy Phased-out). The Act implemented a number of changes, but the most significant for park owners is the phase-out of flood insurance subsidies for certain property owners. The rationale for the phase-out is twofold: (a) To bring in more revenue for FEMA; and (b) To make the cost of flood insurance more accurately reflect the actuarial risk. The result, not surprisingly, is that many property owners are now finding themselves facing the prospect of unaffordable coverage and/or properties they are unable to sell due to unexpectedly high flood insurance premiums. 

Problem No. Two (Re-drawing FEMA Maps). In addition, FEMA has been redrawing the flood maps for communities across the US.  As a result, some properties not previously required to obtain flood insurance have now been classified as high-risk. 

Coverage and Rates. Under the Act, homeowners, renters, and business owners may purchase federally-backed flood insurance through private brokers. Rates and coverage is federally determined and is identical regardless of insurer; rates are set in compliance with the Program. Here is a summary of coverage:  

•	Homeowners may insure for up to $250,000 in property damage plus $100,000 for the contents of the property;
•	Renters may insure for up to $100,000 for the contents of their rental unit;
•	Business owners may insure for up to $500,000 for the premises and contents of their business in total; 
•	Owners of multi-family housing (5+ units) are entitled to a full $500,000 coverage policy and unit occupiers may insure the contents of their dwellings separately for up to $100,000.

High-Risk Areas. Insurance is available for homeowners and business owners in high-risk areas, called Special Flood Hazard Areas (“SFHAs”).  They are defined as “any land that would be inundated by a flood having a 1-percent chance of occurring in a given year.” These areas are identified and mapped by FEMA. Home or business owners in SFHAs who acquire a loan from a federally regulated and insured lender must carry insurance for the life of the loan. This constitutes just about every residential loan program in the marketplace, i.e. conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, etc. - except private loans. Just the same as with fire insurance, if coverage lapses, lenders may “force-place” a flood insurance policy on the property. Homeowners, renters, and business owners in low-to-moderate risk areas may also purchase flood insurance, although it is not mandatory.

The Subsidy Phase-Out. The phase-out is expected to affect roughly 20% of properties under the Plan, or about 1.12 million of the 5.6 million flood insurance policies in effect. Initially, structures built before a community adopted a “Flood Insurance Rate Map” (“FIRM”) were allowed to purchase flood insurance coverage with subsidized rates. [These are referred to as “Pre-FIRM” properties.]  Now, under the Act, the Pre-FIRM Properties, estimated to be about 5% of the 1.12 million flood-insured properties, will see increases phased-in immediately. Additionally, the following properties – formerly subsidized – will also see their premiums increase: 

1.	Second homes;
2.	Businesses;
3.	Severe repetitive loss properties – properties with 1-4 residences making multiple claims under flood insurance policies;
4.	Substantially improved or damaged properties.

Subsidies will be phased out at a rate of 25% per year until the property owner is paying premiums commensurate to the property’s risk level.  This will apply to: (a) Any property purchased after the effective date of July 6, 2012; and (b) Any property not previously covered by flood insurance.  Any property that was covered by a lapsed policy, including primary residences, will not be eligible for any subsidy going forward. For park owners whose property is located in a flood zone, this could mean a substantial increase in premiums.

Last week’s article dealt with the National Flood Insurance Program (“the Program”) that was created by Congress in 1968 to mitigate the financial impact of floods on residents and communities. It also encouraged smarter planning choices [and discouraged some development] in areas with an unacceptable risk of flooding. The NFIP is controlled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”). Effective, July 6, 2012, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (“the Act”) became law. It mandated that flood insurance premiums were to be re-adjusted upward to reflect actuarial risk.  Up until now, the federal government had subsidized premiums, keeping them artificially low.  This new law has received little public attention – until now.  This is because the new premium structures were to commence on October 1, 2013. You can link to Part One of the article here: http://www.mhco.org/news-and-resources/community-updates/manufactured-housing-communities-or-near-floodplains ~PCQ

Re-drawing FEMA Maps. As if the new rate schedules did not create enough of a problem [as discussed in Part One], FEMA has been redrawing the flood maps for communities across the United States. As a result, some properties not previously required to obtain flood insurance have now been classified as high-risk. 

Here is how FEMA describes its mapping responsibilities:

“Through its Flood Hazard Mapping Program, FEMA identifies flood hazards, assesses flood risks, and partners with States and communities to provide accurate flood hazard and risk data to guide them to mitigation actions. Flood Hazard Mapping is an important part of the National Flood Insurance Program, as it is the basis of the NFIP regulations and flood insurance requirements.  FEMA maintains and updates data through Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and risk assessments.  FIRMs include statistical information such as data for river flow, storm tides, hydrologic/hydraulic analyses, and rainfall and topographic surveys.  FEMA uses the best available technical data to create the flood hazard maps that outline your community’s different flood risk areas.”

The following FEMA website contains extensive information regarding its risk mapping program: http://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program-flood-hazard-mapping 

In 2004 Oregon became involved with FEMA’s national five-year program called “Map Modernization, or “Map Mod”.  It was designed to update the nation’s aging floodplain maps.  Much of Oregon’s mapping was created in the 1980’s and earlier and had not been updated.  Obviously, the accuracy of these maps has suffered from out-of-date base data. FEMA’s Map Mod program ended in 2010.  


Today, FEMA’s risk mapping, assessment, and planning has assumed the responsibility for updating the information. A part of that responsibility will include re-drawing of maps.  This updating has resulted in bringing more property into the flood risk zones.

Obviously, with Superstorm Sandy, much of the attention regarding flood zones and re-mapping has focused on the east coast.  According to a January 28, 2013 Wall Street Journal article: 

The revision means tens of thousands of homeowners, landlords and businesses will have to rebuild with increased flood protections or face higher insurance premiums, while others will likely be forced to purchase flood insurance for the first time. Some structures are slated to be upgraded from A zones, where chances of flooding are about 1%, to V zones considered much more likely to flood as a result of storm surges

Are Oregonians going to face similar increases due to the redrawing of maps?  It is highly likely.  Why?  Because FEMA is now expected to stand on its own, i.e. premiums are to be increased so there will be sufficient reserves to meet future flood disasters.  However, with the outcry from flood insurance premium “sticker shock,” it is likely that FEMA will look to other sources of revenue – and this likely means the expansion of flood zones, since that will generate new additional revenues for an agency that has been used to drawing funds from the Treasury Department whenever it could not make ends meet.

MHCO Member Tips.  If your community is near a waterway, including the ocean, you should be aware of the possibility that some of the park is – or will be – in a flood zone.  You should check with your county officials to verify. Secondly, in view of ORS 90.228,  park owners should remember to give the required notice to residents.  Even though residents own their own homes, they are renting the space, and the Oregon landlord-tenant law defines the space as a “dwelling unit” for purposes of the manufactured housing side of the law.

Re-Posted from November 25, 2013

_____________________________________________________________________

Introduction.  As you know, in the 2013 Legislative Session, we were able to defeat – or at least forestall – passage of HB 3007, a bill that extensively re-worked the current law governing resident park purchases.   However, MHCO and other stake-holders, agreed that we would work diligently to see if we could find a middle ground.  An interim work group of park industry representatives was appointed to do so.  In June 2013, the MHCO board unanimously voted to direct me to work with John VanLandingham to see if we could find a solution that did not expand the current park-purchase law, but rather mirrored currently existing protocol and clarified the landlord-tenant notification process. 

For the ensuing months, the interim work group held meetings with Rep. Gene Whisnant (Republican - Bend)) and Rep. Nancy Nathanson (Democrat - Eugene), seeking to develop legislation satisfactory to all concerned.  I worked closely with John VanLandingham during this time, as we emailed concepts back and forth. During the week of November 18-22, we aggregated these concepts into a written proposal for review by the interim group and Reps. Nathanson and Whisnant.  

At a meeting held on Tuesday, November 19, with some minor adjustments, I am happy to report that consensus was reached.  Summarized below – in broad strokes – are the major concepts that will be drafted into new legislation to replace the current right of first refusal law.  Caveat: Although preliminary consensus has been reached, there is no final bill yet, and much work remains to be done to see this though to a successful piece of legislation. 

1.	Landlord Notice to Tenants. The landlord would send a written notice to each resident and to the state housing agency at the time the landlord intended to commence marketing the park for sale, or upon receipt of an offer of purchase that the landlord intended to consider (whichever first occurs). The written notice would inform residents of the following: 
a.	That they have an opportunity to compete to buy the park; 
b.	They have 10-calendar days (the owner may offer more time) to notify the owner in writing that they are interested in competing to buy the park; 
c.	That within that 10-calendar day period the residents would designate a representative to communicate with the park owner; and
d.	Notify the tenants of the availability of the OHCS/MCRC handout regarding park purchase rights.
e.	The notice would be sent to all residents  unless there was already in place an active  park purchase committee (“PPC”). Alternatively, if there was an existing committee, such as a “committee of seven” as authorized under ORS 90.600(5) that would suffice for purposes of permitting the park owner to give notice to them, rather than every resident in the park.
 
2.	Landlord Right to Seek and Negotiate With Other Buyers: Throughout this process, the landlord is permitted to seek and/or negotiate with other buyers.

3.	Financial Information. Within the 10-calendar day period, the residents’ designated contact person may request the following financial information in order to evaluate a possible purchase.  The landlord would provide the financial information within seven (7) days following receipt of the request. 
a.	Asking price, if there is one;
b.	Annual park-covered utility expenses;
c.	Annual insurance expense (most recent premium);
d.	Current vacancies ;
e.	Income (lump sum, not by space) – including any park related profit centers, e.g. storage, etc. 
f.	The number of park-owned homes.

4.	Confidentiality. The landlord may designate the financial information “Confidential.” There will be a list of permissible transferees of this information, e.g. the purchase committee attorneys, tax advisors, etc. They can be required to sign a confidentiality agreement. The information provided to the purchase committee is to be returned to the landlord intact at the conclusion of negotiations or termination of purchase efforts. The tenants would have the right to review the information presented, but it could not be copied, in whole or in part. 

5.	Timing. Within 15 calendar days following receipt of the owner’s financial information, the purchase committee is required to:
a.	Form a corporate entity capable of purchasing the park or associate with a nonprofit corporation or housing authority capable of purchasing the park and/or providing park purchase assistance and advice; 
b.	Submit an offer to purchase the park in the form of a purchase and sale agreement (“PSA”) together with a copy of the filed corporate articles or other verification of legal capacity to purchase and hold title.
c.	The terms of the transaction, including offering price, due diligence duties, schedules, timelines, conditions and any extensions are to be spelled out in the PSA.
d.	The park owner and the purchase committee, including all park residents must act in a “commercially reasonable manner”  throughout the negotiations.  
During the 15-day period, the owner may accept the tenants’ offer, submit a counter-offer with different terms, or reject the offer. If accepted or countered the transaction moves forward according to the terms. If rejected, the transaction is over.  It is no different than in any other commercial transaction.

6.	Termination of Landlord’s Duty to Negotiate Further. The landlord’s duty to negotiate further ends:
a.	If the residents fail to act with the initial ten (10) calendar day period following the owner’s notice of intent to market the property;
b.	If they fail to form the purchase entity and/or fail to submit the PSA within the 15 day period following receipt of the landlord’s financial information; or 
c.	If the parties fail to reach agreement on the price and terms of a deal.

7.	Penalties for Noncompliance. An outrageous act in total disregard of the statutes would be a violation under the Landlord-Tenant Act (e.g. the landlord closed a sale without notifying the residents according to law), with a damage formula similar to what currently exists under the Act: E.g. $X per violation, or actual damages, whichever is greater.  Injunctive relief would be available if the residents learned that the owner was negotiating to sell the park without giving notice to residents.  

8.	Exemptions: All current exemptions are retained except transactions where the park owner is going to place the funds with an accommodator in order to secure a tax deferred exchange. 

That will not be included under the opportunity to purchase law.   An exemption for charitable remainder trusts will be added.  

9.	Affidavit of Compliance: The provision requiring a park owner to sign an affidavit at the time of closing, certifying that he/she complied with the law, will be retained. All title companies require this, and there was no reason to eliminate it.

10.	Remove Current Right of First Refusal Language: The current law attempted to give residents what it called a “right of first refusal.”  However, that term, which has a specific legal meaning, was never defined operationally.  How long did the right last? Could the owner negotiate with anyone else during that time?  These questions were never addressed in the law, and it is this kind of uncertainty that results in disputes and lawsuits.  This provision will disappear under the new law.

"429","429","3","Medical Marijuana Policy in Manufactured Housing Communities - Sample ","By:   Phillip C. Querin, QUERIN LAW, LLC

Under federal law, marijuana in all forms is a controlled substance. Under Oregon law, limited use is permissible with a Medical Marijuana Card. The Oregon laws are linked here. The statutes cover such things as grow-site registration; medical uses for marijuana; issuance of an identification card; and limitations on a cardholder’s immunity from criminal laws involving marijuana.  For those interested, these statutes should be consulted.  

You have a responsibility to make sure that laws are not being violated in the community. You also have a responsibility to the rest of the other residents. Compliance with all laws is a condition of occupancy under the park’s rental agreement, its rules, and the Oregon Residential Landlord-Tenant Act.  As I have said previously, I know of no way you can honor your obligations except to ask to see the card and verify that it is current and held in the name of the resident.  

If a resident has a valid card, then arguably he or she is presumed to have some medical condition that has authorized its issuance.  Do not question the person regarding the underlying need for the card. Does he or she have a legal right to demand that under the Fair Housing Laws, you make a “reasonable accommodation” for his or her medical condition, and permit him to continue in his grow operation?   Not necessarily.  

Oregon fair housing law is ""substantially equivalent"" to federal fair housing law.”  So, generally speaking, on the issue of medical marijuana, as goes the federal law, so goes Oregon law.  In the 2010 case of Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, the Oregon Supreme Court addressed many unanswered questions on the use of medical marijuana in this state.  The answers contained in that case represent the most current state of medical marijuana law in Oregon both from an employment and housing perspective.  

An article by the Fair Housing Counsel of Oregon (found here) is helpful on the issue. To reiterate what I have said both in writing and at the 2013 MHCO Annual Convention, it is my opinion that park management should institute a written medical marijuana policy in its rules, dealing both with the use and cultivation of the substance inside the community.  It is not a fair housing violation to prohibit medical marijuana in the community’s rules.   However, if legal use or cultivation [i.e. according to Oregon state law] occurs in a community, and there is no existing rule against doing so, it may be difficult to bring an eviction action for the activity, unless it violates some other rule or provision in the rental agreement. 

//////////////////

Accordingly, here is a sample policy.  It should not be regarded as legal advice, and all parks and managers should have their marijuana policy reviewed by their own legal counsel.  

SAMPLE MEDICAL MARIJUANA POLICY
[TO BE ENACTED PURSUANT TO ORS 90.610(3)]

BACKGROUND. UNDER THE FEDERAL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT, 21 U.S.C. § 801, ET SEQ., IT IS ILLEGAL TO MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, AND POSSESS MARIJUANA, EVEN WHEN STATE LAW AUTHORIZES ITS USE. IN OREGON, MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA IS LEGAL, SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN ORS 475.300 TO 475.342.  FEDERAL LAW SUPERSEDES STATE LAW WHERE THERE IS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF LAWS.  THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING AMENDMENTS ACT PROVIDES THAT A DISABILITY DOES NOT ALLOW THE ILLEGAL USE OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UNDER THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT. 
OUR POLICY. ALL RESIDENTS, THEIR GUESTS, INVITEES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND OTHERS COMING TO THE RESIDENT’S HOME, SPACE, OR COMMON AREAS IN THE COMMUNITY, ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING RULES REGARDING THE MANUFACTURE, USE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF MARIJUANA FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING MEDICAL PURPOSES:
PROHIBITION.  THIS COMMUNITY STRICTLY FORBIDS THE MANUFACTURE, USE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF MARIJUANA FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING MEDICAL PURPOSES. RESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INFORMING THEIR GUESTS, INVITEES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND ALL OTHERS OF THIS POLICY. 

REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.  THIS COMMUNITY WILL NOT AGREE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE MANUFACTURE, USE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF MARIJUANA FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING MEDICAL PURPOSES, TO ANY RESIDENTS, THEIR GUESTS, INVITEES, CONTACTORS, EMPLOYEES OR OTHERS COMING TO THE RESIDENT’S HOME, SPACE OR COMMON AREA, BASED UPON THE STATE OR FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING AMENDMENTS ACT.
VIOLATION. VIOLATION OF THIS POLICY SHALL CONSTITUTE A BREACH OF THE TERMS OF RESIDENT’S RIGHT OF OCCUPANCY, AND ENTITLE MANAGEMENT TO ISSUE RESIDENT A THIRTY (30) DAY CURABLE NOTICE OF VIOLATION UNDER ORS 90.630(1).  A REPEAT VIOLATION WILL RESULT IN A TWENTY (20) DAY NON-CURABLE NOTICE OF VIOLATION UNDER ORS 90.630(4).  RESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INFORMING THEIR GUESTS, INVITEES, CONTACTORS, EMPLOYEES OR OTHERS COMING TO RESIDENT’S HOME, SPACE OR COMMON AREA GUESTS OF THIS POLICY AND FOR ENSURING COMPLIANCE.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRECEDING, MANAGEMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT, UPON ITS SOLE DISCRETION, TO ISSUE RESIDENT A NON-CURABLE 24-HOUR NOTICE OF VIOLATION UNDER ORS 90.396 IF RESIDENT’S VIOLATION OF THIS POLICY COULD REASONABLY RESULT IN DANGER TO THE HEALTH, SAFETY OR WELFARE OF OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY.  

EFFECTIVE DATE.  THIS POLICY SHALL APPLY FROM AND AFTER _______________________ (“EFFECTIVE DATE”), UNTIL MODIFIED OR AMENDED.  IT SHALL NOT BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY TO ANY RESIDENT WHOSE LEGAL USE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA HAS BEEN EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY MANAGEMENT PURSUANT TO RESIDENT’S REQUEST FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE.","By:   Phillip C.

MHCO Legal Counsel

Discussion:  MHCO has previously published a summary of the new 2013 laws directly impacting owners and managers of manufactured housing communities. The purpose of this article is to address the new landlord-tenant laws that apply to those situations in which park owners rent out park-owned homes. 
  
SENATE BILL 91

TENANT LIABILITY INSURANCE [Note: This law applies only to situations in which the tenant is not the owner of the home, i.e. the tenant is renting both the home and the space inside a manufactured housing community. This law is currently in effect.]

•	A landlord may require a tenant to obtain and maintain renter’s liability insurance upon the following conditions:
o	It may not exceed $100,000 per occurrence (or the customary amount required by landlords for similar properties with similar rents in the same market, whichever is greater).
•	Before entering into a new tenancy, the landlord:
o	Must advise the applicant in writing of the insurance requirement and the amount of coverage;
o	May require proof of coverage before the tenancy commences;
o	Must include in the rental agreement the insurance requirements under the statute.
•	For an existing tenancy, the landlord may amend the rental agreement upon giving not less than 30-days’ notice of the insurance requirement
•	It the tenant fails to obtain the insurance where required the landlord may terminate the tenancy under ORS 90.392, and the tenant may cure the default by complying within 30 days;
•	The landlord may require that the tenant provide verification of coverage period.
•	The landlord may not require liability insurance if the landlord does not also have a comparable policy.
o	The tenant my request orally or in writing that the landlord provide verification of coverage;
o	Landlord may comply by providing a coy by personal delivery, mail, or posting in a common area;
o	Neither landlord nor tenant may harass the other with repeated requests for verification.
•	Landlord may not:
o	Require tenant use a particular insurer;

HOUSE BILL 2639

Discussion: This Bill addresses several topics, including the creation of a ‘Housing Choice Landlord Guarantee Program” to mitigate damages to landlords’ dwelling units caused by tenants receiving Section 8 assistance, and revisions to state discrimination laws.  It applies to both tenants inside and outside of manufactured communities, i.e. regardless of whether the tenant owns their home or not. It becomes effective on July 1, 2014

SOURCE OF INCOME AND PAST CONDUCT IN SCREENING PROCESS 
•	Currently, a person may not, because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status, or source of income, refuse to sell, lease or rent any real property to a prospective renter/lessee.
o	“Source of income” now includes federal rent subsidy payments under Section 8 and any other local, state or federal housing assistance;
o	“Source of income” does not include income derived from a specific occupation or income derived in an illegal manner.
•	HB 2639 clarifies that the preceding prohibition does not prevent a person from refusing to rent or lease real property to a prospective renter/lessee based upon:
o	Their past conduct, so long as the refusal is consistent with local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to fair housing laws; or
o	The prospective renter’s/lessee’s inability to pay rent, taking into consideration the value of their local, state and federal housing assistance (e.g. Section 8).
•	Provided, however, the refusal to lease or rent based on the inability to pay rent must be consistent with local, state and federal law, including but not limited to fair housing laws.
•	Discussion. Regardless of the legal reason for rejecting a prospective renter/lessee, in all cases, landlords must be consistent with all applicants.  The risk and liability is very real; testers can find minor variations in a manager’s response, and depending upon what was said, claim that one tester was treated discriminatorily.  Similarly, owners and managers should always be consistent in following the screening criteria they have published.  If they do not rent to persons with a criminal record, they should be careful about making exceptions. It is the same for financial qualifications and ability to pay the rent.   

THE HOUSING CHOICE LANDLORD GUARANTEE PROGRAM

"431","431","3","Phil Querin Q&A Do new Oregon laws on ""Section 8"" and other sources of income mean that any applicant receiving assistance must be accepted as a resident?","Question: I just read the information regarding House Bill 2639, which addresses source of income and states that a person may not, because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status, or source of income, refuse to sell, lease or rent any real property to a prospective renter/lessee. The bill states that ""Source of Income"" now includes federal rent subsidy payments under Section 8 and any other local, state or federal housing assistance. I have always refused to accept any applicant who does not have sufficient income to pay the rent.  My policy is that a renter can pay no-more than 33% of their income for housing.  Does BILL 2638 mean that I must now rent to Section 8 applicants or anyone who is received rent subsidy payments?  

Answer:  HB 2639 will become effective on July 1, 2014. It applies to all housing, whether or not it is manufactured housing inside of a community.  The current law provides that a landlord may not refuse to sell, lease or rent any real property to a prospective lessee or tenant based upon the following factors:
•	Race;
•	Color;
•	Religion;
•	Sex;
•	Sexual orientation;
•	National origin;
•	Marital status;
•	Familial status (i.e. children under 18 years of age); and
•	Source of income.
Under HB 2639 “source of income” now includes federal rent subsidy payments under Section 8 and any other local, state or federal housing assistance.  [However, it does not include income derived from a specific occupation or income derived in an illegal manner.]

Your concern is misplaced, but you still must be careful. HB 2639 clarifies that the prohibition against discrimination does not prevent you from refusing to rent or lease real property to a prospective renter/lessee based upon their inability to pay rent.  If you have a 33% rule, and consistently apply it, you should be fine.  However, what you must do is to include in your 33% calculation, any moneys the applicant is receiving from other state, local, or federal assistance, including Section 8 subsidies (collectively “Government Assistance”).  You may not deny an applicant solely because they are receiving Government Assistance, and you must include it in your calculations.  

Conclusion. It is my opinion that HB 2639 means that going forward, you should include all Government Assistance, as well as other income, when calculating your applicants’ ability to pay the space rent.  In other words, just because they receive Government Assistance does not mean that you may deny them occupancy.  Lastly, even if they qualify under your 33% rule, after including their Government Assistance, if there are other legitimate grounds for denial, such as prior rental history or criminal record, you are still legally entitled to reject them.  

Please understand that this is not legal advice, and you should verify my interpretation with you own attorney.

"486","486","3","Phil Querin Q&A Resident Improvements and Building Code Compliance","Question: I have a resident who was given permission to build a permanent carport.  Most all of the carports in our park are free standing and permanent which is my preference. However, he constructed the permanent carport by boring holes in the ground and filling them with concrete and inserting metal mounts to which he fastened 4x4 uprights for the carport.  Building it this way, in my opinion, made it part of the real property.  I was there when construction started but was absent when it was completed. 

What now complicates matters is that he recently decided to sell the manufactured home, including the carport.  This would not have been an issue had the buyer not planned on moving the home.  I believe that since the carport is now permanently affixed to the ground, it cannot be sold as movable personal property along with the home.  He also attached the carport to the manufactured home which may complicate things, as well.  What are my rights here?

Answer:  This situation is not directly addressed in the Oregon manufactured housing laws.  First, some general observations: The manufactured housing side of the landlord-tenant law regards the “space” as the “premises.”  For example, a resident in an apartment may not, without landlord permission, intentionally make major structural changes to the interior of the premises. However, most apartments have rules against this, or it is included in the rental agreement. Your space agreement or rules may have similar prohibitions regarding major changes to the space.

In this case, however, you permitted the work to commence.  It is unclear whether you had reviewed any plans, before the work started.  You should have made this a condition of building the carport in the first place.  What about permits?  It is unclear whether they are required in your jurisdiction, but it is something you should always make sure is complied with.  

I am unclear what you mean when you say that other such structures are “free standing and permanent.”  If they are permanent, in the sense of being permanently affixed to the space, then presumably, you are treating these as structures that would remain if the home were sold and removed.  However, your independent conclusion that a structure is “permanent” and therefor stays with the space is really not the complete issue; what does the resident believe?  It was his money that presumably paid for the work, and he may have some say in whether he intended it to be a part of the home, and movable if the time came.  The same issues pertain to the new buyer.

While your opinion is important, so are those of your resident and his buyer.  For this reason, I suggest that before doing this again, you might consider addressing it in the community rules.  Some of the things that should be covered are the following:

•	Code compliance
•	Management pre-approval of completed drawings
•	Time to complete work
•	Your right to post a notice of non-responsibility for liens if the resident hires a contractor
•	Method of affixing to the ground
•	Safety of final structure and perhaps inspector sign-off
•	Who owns the structure upon completion?
•	Can it be removed upon sale and removal of the home (I suggest “yes” so long as the space is returned to its original condition and all holes are safely and completed filled, etc.)
•	Duty to keep the carport in good and safe condition – remember if it is a part of the space, absent agreement with the resident, it would be your duty, since you own the park.

In this particular case, I suggest that if you have not pre-addressed these issues with your resident, he may believe this is his structure to do with as he sees fit.  I really can’t disagree, since you permitted the project and from your question, it appears no ground rules were established regarding ownership in the event the home was moved. However, if you permit the carport structure to be removed, you should insist that the space be returned to its original pre-construction condition.  That’s about the best you can do with this situation, although establishing rules – or at least agreed-upon terms – before construction commences again, is a good idea.

"449","449","3","Phil Querin Q&A Sub Metering and Common Areas","Question: We have some questions regarding common area billing for the water sub-meters that we’re installing.  I understand that under certain circumstances, there is an “offset” we can take against the total rent reductions we are required to give residents for the common areas.  How does all that work?

Answer: The submetering statutes, ORS 90.531 – 90.539 are complex and confusing. As most owners and managers know who have explored converting to submeters, the concept is relatively simple.  But the devil is in the details, i.e. the statutes. The basic concept is that for communities with utilities [e.g. water and sewer] that are buried in the base rent, they may extract those charges from base rent, and pass them through to the residents directly for payment. The “quid pro quo” for this is that the residents' base rent is reduced in a commensurate amount, so in theory, there is no initial net difference to landlord or tenant. But when utilities are increased, it becomes the residents’ immediate responsibility to pay the increased charge – the landlord no longer has to raise the rent via a 90-day notice to recover the increase.

Your question specifically pertains to one of the “devilish details’ of this conversion process, i.e. passing through the utility cost for common areas. Specifically, you are referring to subsection (5) of ORS 90.537 (“Conversion of billing method for utility or service charges”).  

That statute provides that a landlord who has previously included utilities and services in their base rent [called “the rent billing method”] and converts to the “submeter billing method” may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submetering, begin billing for common areas to a “pro rata billing method”  [i.e. where the residents’ cost of the utility is charged and paid separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter].  This common area charge must be included in the 180-day notice to residents that precedes the submeter conversion process.  This means that the landlord would charge each resident a prorata portion of the master meter readings attributable to common area costs.  

Obviously, master meter readings do not distinguish between utility services provided to residents, versus those provided to common areas.  For purposes of determining the amount of the offset the landlord should check with the utility provider to find out the cost of its service to the common areas.  If the provider cannot provide the landlord with an accurate cost for service to the common areas, the landlord “shall assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed.”
 
Note: Only if the landlord continues use the rent billing method for the cost of utilities to the common areas may the landlord may obtain an offset against the total rent reduction given to residents. This is because if the common area utility cost is still buried inside the base rent. It would be unfair to the landlord to require a dollar-for-dollar rent reduction for all utilities, since those attributed to the common areas are not passed directly through to the tenants for separate payment.

In other words, the right of offset “…is not available if the landlord chooses to bill for the common areas using the pro rata method.”  If the cost of the utility service to the common area is apportioned on a prorate basis and passed through to the residents, there will be no need for offset against the rent reduction as a part of the conversion to submeters.   In those cases, the landlord may only apportion the common area utility cost on a prorata basis. 

For purposes of determining the pro rata charge per resident, ORS 90.534 (“Allocated charges for utility or service provided directly to space or common area”) clarifies the protocol to be followed:
•	A utility charge that is assessed to residents on a pro rata basis must be allocated among them “…by a method that reasonably apportions the cost among the affected tenants and that is described in the rental agreement.”
•	Methods that reasonably apportion the cost among the residents include, but are not limited to, methods that divide the cost based on:
o	The number of occupied spaces  in the facility;
o	The number of residents or occupants in the home compared with the number of residents or occupants in the facility, if there is a correlation with consumption of the utility or service; or
o	The square footage in each home compared with the total square footage of occupied homes in the facility, if there is a correlation with consumption of the utility or service.
•	A utility or service charge to be assessed to a resident for a common area must be described in the written rental agreement separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge for the tenant’s space.
•	A landlord may not:
o	 Bill or collect more money from residents for utilities or services than the provider charges the landlord;
o	Increase the utility or service charge to a resident by adding any costs of the landlord, such as handling or administrative charges.

"434","434","3","Phil Querin Q&A Selling Park-owned Carports to Residents","Question: At my park we would like to offer the park-owned carports for sale to the residents for $1.  I am under the impression that if we require this of all residents that we would have to give a rent reduction equivalent to the value of the carports.  Is this true?  And if this is a voluntary program (i.e. the residents can buy them if they want and then turn them into enclosed garages), would a rent reduction still be required?  

Answer:  There is no specific law regarding this issue.  However, you clearly understand the ramifications i.e. if a service or amenity is withdrawn, the inference usually is that the landlord has received some financial benefit.  In this case, the “benefit” is that the landlord is no longer responsible for maintenance, and the resident is.  My position generally is that this type of arrangement should net out to zero in cost/benefit to both sides. That is, here, if the cost of maintenance is shifted from the landlord to the resident, then there must be some offsetting benefit to the resident.  If you believe you can allocate the estimated cost that has been shifted to the resident, e.g. $5.00 per month [I am using the figure as an example – I have no idea what the actual figure might be. – PCQ] then there would be a commensurate $5.00/month reduction in rent.

The more difficult issue is whether you may “require” this.  I doubt it. The residents never signed on to ownership of a park amenity when they commenced their lease or rental. In fact, a cynic would say that you’re only doing this because of the condition or age of the carports.  I’m not, but I’m suspecting this as a response from some if you attempted to “require” that all residents assume ownership of them.  

There is also the issue of the condition of the carports. Are you going to warrant to each resident that they are in good condition?  Or, is this going to be an AS-IS sale? If the latter you most certainly cannot require they agree to take over ownership of carports when you decline to stand behind their quality.

If the idea is that once bought, a resident could “upgrade” them, you need to think the idea all the way through.  For example, any such construction must first be approved by Management. Are you going to require that all work must be performed by bonded contractors who have liability insurance and are licensed with the Construction Contractors Board?  You will need to post a Notice of Nonresponsibility for construction liens.  [I have seen liens imposed on park owned property for a resident’s construction project that was (foolishly) approved by Management.]  Are you going to permit residents to do the construction work themselves? If so, you must make clear that the work must be performed in accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances, especially the applicable building codes.  Who is going to then monitor construction to make sure what was approved is what was built? Is the manager qualified to do this, and does he/she have time?  Are you going to require the residents undertaking construction [either themselves or through a contractor] first sign an agreement to assume all liability and release the park and Management from damages?  If a third party does the work, besides licensing, you have to make sure they have workers comp insurance (i.e. SAIF).  You cannot assume all contractors have this insurance. The smaller the contractor, e.g. solos, the greater the chance they may have neglected to obtain workers comp.  If there were an accident resulting in personal injuries, e.g. falling off the roof of the new garage, without SAIF, the injured worker could look to you.

Lastly, what are you going to do upon sale of the home?  I assume the resident will be selling title to the garage. Since the garage is affixed to the land, would assume a regular “deed” be given, as opposed to a bill of sale [as is common for personal property, such as a manufactured home]. So how is this going to work?  Certainly, you don’t want residents delivering deeds to the garage, since they actually don’t own the underlying land. Yet once affixed to the land, the garage becomes a part of the land. You will certainly have to cover this issue if/when you undertake this program.  It’s possible that you would just give a revocable “license” or “permit” to the resident, allowing the use and construction, but not pure ownership.  And be careful of a resident claiming that you owe them for the value of the improvement, since upon resale of the home, you might increase the space rent because of the “enclosed garage.” 

In light of all the issues, it seems that if you decide to plow ahead with this idea, it seems to me that it should be voluntary, with adequate disclosures and releases per above, so that the resident can never say they had no choice in the matter.  There is little question in my mind, that if you made this program mandatory, a court of law would not enforce it, no matter how ironclad.

",,"1392050514","2"
"454","454","3","HB 4038A - Myths and Misconceptions","By:  Phil Querin, Querin Law.

[Remember, MHCO’s goal with HB 4038A was not to reinvent the wheel, but to make minimal changes to the current statute, amending only that which was in need of correction or change. That was always the consensus in this effort.]


 Under HB 4038A if an owner is considering selling his/her park, he/she must notify the residents. But what does “consider” mean?  I’m afraid that if I “consider” selling my park tomorrow that I will be required to then notify the residents. This is too vague! 

False. You have misread the proposed law. It does not say you must notify the residents just because you are “considering” selling your park. It only requires notice to the residents if you decide that you want to sell your park, or if you receive an offer that you “intend to consider.” This language is exactly the same as in the current law, and given the fact that heretofore, most park owners understood it, we saw no need for a change. You and you alone have the power to decide when you want to sell your park, or whether you will “intend to consider” an offer you have received. Hopefully, when that time comes, you will know instinctually in your gut what to do. It is that decision which triggers whether you will notify the residents.

 Park owners must send a notice of opportunity to purchase to every tenant in the park. Not necessarily. 

Under HB 4038A, the park owner may send the notice to an existing resident committee if one has been formed [whose purposes includes park purchases] and the owner has met with them within the preceding 12 months. This permits those owners who do not want to give notice to all residents to encourage the creation of such a resident committee in advance. HB 4038 now provides that honest errors in giving notices will not defeat the owner’s ability to sell the park to a third party. Keep in mind that notice to all residents is required in many other parts of the landlord-tenant act, such as rent raises, utility conversions, and rules changes.

 Park owners are at risk if they can’t find all residents for the notice. For example, if a tenant is renting the home to someone else. 

This comment demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of Oregon landlord-tenant law. To be a park tenant, one must both own and live in the home.
Absentee homeowners are not “tenants,” and occupying sub-tenants are not “owners.” (See, ORS 90.100 (47)(b).) In addition, Oregon law does not require landlords to “prove” that their tenant received a notice, only that it was given. (See, ORS 90.155.)

 Residents only have to notify the owner of their “interest” and there could be some that are interested and others not. There are no minimum requirements to determine how many residents must respond. 

Correct. This approach is contained in the existing law and was retained; we do not agree that MHCO or the legislature should ever try to dictate internal governance issues for park residents.

 The park owner must give financial information to all of the residents. 

False. HB 4038A put strict controls over dissemination of basic financial information that, if requested, will be turned over to a single representative designated by the residents. There are no comparable provisions under current law permitting a single point of contact. The documents can be marked “confidential”and include a list of persons to whom the information may be shared, such as financial advisors, attorneys, etc. The designated persons may not copy the material, and must return it upon completion of the process. This is not inconsistent with current standards of practice in commercial real estate transactions, where owners market their property for sale. The current park sale law says nothing about turning over financial information. This is a mistake, since residents need it in order to frame a meaningful offer. How can the residents’ experts establish value, without knowing basic income and expense information? All standard valuation models include a cap rate and/or a gross rent multiplier for commercial income property. Without basic information, any opportunity to purchase would be a meaningless; all serious third party purchasers would require it.

 The residents can submit an offer but aren’t required to provide proof of their financial capacity to close the transaction. 

As in the current law, there is no effort to dictate the terms of the residents’ offer. Our minimalist approach and goal was not to re-invent the wheel – but to keep things simple. HB 4038A says that the owner may accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. It does not require the owner to explain why he/she is accepting or rejecting. A tenant purchase offer that makes no effort to clarify their financial bona fides [e.g. by a lender’s pre-approval letter or other confirmation of financial capacity] is likely inviting a rejection. Landlords are not required to accept or counter weak offers. However, it is my own opinion, that park owners should always treat the residents’ offer with the same seriousness as any other third-party offer.

 The park owner can always reject the offer but takes the risk of being sued with an injunction blocking any other sale. 

Welcome to the real world. Anyone can sue anyone at any time. This risk has always existed under the current park sale law, and no amount of drafting will prevent that. Again, the goal was not to radically change the current park sale law, but to clean it up and clarify it where needed. The goal was never to make it more complex. Different from the current law, HB 4038A clarifies that if the owner sells the park and records an affidavit of compliance, the buyer and title company are absolutely protected. In other words, the sale cannot be set aside. That preserves the owner’s ability to convey marketable title. Additionally,
￼2
HB 4038A makes it clear that park owners may solicit other buyers throughout this process - something not addressed under current law.

 After they have received the financial information, residents have another 15 days to either form a corporate purchase entity or associate with a non-profit purchase group. What is an “associate”? A drinking buddy? This term is too vague! 

The question is nonsensical. Current law uses this term elsewhere without objection or confusion. The word “associate” may either be used as a verb (such as “to associate with a particular group”) or a noun (as in “I’d like to introduce you to my associate”). The text of HB 4038A is clear that the term “associate” is used in the verb form. This objection is either tongue-in-cheek, or the commenter does not understand the difference between verbs and nouns.

 HB 4 0 3 8 A has taken away the Sec. 1031 exclusion from park owners. 

False. If your buyer wants to exchange into your property under IRC 1031, there are limited time frames for his/her performance. This type of transaction is still exempted from the park sale law. You do not need to notify the residents. However, HB 4038A clarifies that if you want to exchange out of your property, that side of the exchange law is not exempted. Why? Because if you follow your expert’s advice you will have pre-identified the properties you want to exchange into as required by law. Only then do you need to notify the residents of your intent to market and sell the property. You are free to negotiate with the residents as well as any other prospective buyers at the same time. You do not have to hold up your exchange transaction, so long as you follow the protocols in HB 4038A. The residents cannot “make” you give up your 1031 rights. If their offer ignores your 1031 rights you may simply reject it. There was never any reason to exclude this side of the 1031 law from the residents’ opportunity to purchase. HB 3048A merely clears up this oversight. Park owners are not disadvantaged in any respect by this change.","By:  Phil Querin, Querin Law.

The local municipality doesn't charge much of anything for actual water usage...it ends up only being about $6 per month/per space to pay for all water usage in the community. The way the city gets their money is by constantly adding and increasing 'utility fees' like storm drain, public safety, etc.

After running my numbers, I am beginning to question why I even want to go to the expense of installing water meters at all, because if it just ends up raising the monthly out-of-pocket cost for my senior residents, and even If they reduce their water usage significantly, they will only be able to realistically save a dollar or two per month. 

What I would like to do instead is just begin a 'pro rata billing method' for my community electricity, garbage, natural gas and city utility fees.  I would obviously offset their rent amount commensurate with the previous 12 months' total bills. What I cannot figure out after reading the statutes is this:

Can I begin a pro rata billing method for the above mentioned items, with 180 days' written notice, WITHOUT converting to a submeter billing method at the same time?

ORS 90.532 (3) provides as follows:

Except as allowed by subsection (2) of this section for rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010, a landlord and tenant may not amend a rental agreement to convert water or sewer utility and service billing from a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(i) [i.e. where the charge is included in the base rent] ***  to a method described in subsection (1)(b)(C)(ii) [i.e. where the charge is billed separately from base rent and apportioned among the tenants on a pro rata basis as measured by a master meter]. 

The exception covered in subsection ORS 90.532(2) provides as follows:

 A landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method:
      (a) For water service, if the rental agreement for the dwelling unit was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.
      (b) For sewer service, if it is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.



Translating this to plain English, here is my take:

•	For rental agreements entered into on or after January 1, 2010 you may not convert water or sewer charges from an in-rent method to a pro rata billing method except as follows:
o	Water service: If the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless you were using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all 180 spaces immediately before January 1, 2010.
o	Sewer Service: If sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, you may not convert from an in-rent method to a pro rata method, unless you were already using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all 180 spaces immediately before January 1, 2010.
•	Garbage service: You may not convert from an in-rent method to a pro rata billing method unless the pro rata apportionment is based upon the number and size of the garbage receptacles used by the tenant.  There does not appear to be any time frame limitation on this rule

Pursuant to ORS 90.534 [Allocated charges for utility or service provided directly to space or common area], if a written rental agreement so provides, you may use a pro rata billing method with a master meter and require tenants to pay you a utility or service charges (e.g. electrical and natural gas) that has been billed to you or provided directly to the tenant’s space or to a common area. However, you may not unilaterally amend an existing rental agreement to convert utility and service billing from an in-rent billing method to a pro rata billing method. It appears you could use the pro rata billing method (other than sewer and water) per above rules, only on a going forward basis with new residents.

Conclusion.  This is the best I can tell you. It is not legal advice, and based only upon my interpretation of the statutes which are quite complex. It appears that yours is a difficult situation in which water/sewer submetering will not actually help.  With the exception of garbage service, there is no easy answer. However, upon closer evaluation by your attorney, perhaps you may be able to figure out a work-around solution. Good luck!

"458","458","3","Phil Querin Q&A Tree Limb Falls On A Residents House","Question: A tree limb fell through a resident’s roof.  I told him what I believed the recently enacted state law was, but don’t know if I was thorough enough.  Under the old law, tree maintenance was the tenants’ responsibility – period; regardless of whether the landlord or tenant planted and regardless of size. The resident says I should make the space safe.  I told him to take it up with the City of Portland as I wanted to take the tree out when I first developed the property and they said I had to keep the tree.  I told the resident hat my policy had been to split the tree removal cost with the resident and he agreed.  What were my rights here? 

Answer.  Many manufactured housing communities in Oregon have large trees.  While Oregon law has imposed the duty of general tree maintenance on the residents, there is little question but that most do not have the expertise, skill or financial means to provide the type of maintenance that may be required for large older trees.  With this in mind, the MHCO encouraged the Landlord-Tenant Coalition to craft a bill that fairly and clearly allocated the responsibility for tree maintenance in a realistic manner.  Landlords are in a better position than residents to obtain and afford good liability insurance, since it is a standard cost of doing business.  Moreover, there was concern that under the existing law, some park owners might not regard the issue of tree maintenance as their problem.  In reality, however, it is.  Injury or death resulting from falling limb or tree that should have been trimmed or removed is surely going to result in potential liability to the park owner.  Accordingly, the statute allocates the risk in a more realistic and practical manner:  Normal maintenance for trees on a resident’s space remains with the resident. However, if the tree has certain features that make it a “hazard tree” then responsibility shifts to the landlord – unless the resident planted the tree.  This delineation should help both landlords and residents understand their respective responsibilities.  Here is a summary of the current law:
1.	Definitions.
•	“DBH”  means  the  diameter at  breast  height,   which is  measured   as the  width of  a standing tree  at  four  and  one-half feet  above  the  ground  on the  uphill side. 
 
•	“Hazard tree”  means  a tree  that:
o	Is located  on a rented space in  a manufactured dwelling park;
o	Measures  at  least  eight  inches  DBH;  and
o	Is  considered, by  an  arborist licensed  as a  landscape  construction professional pursuant  to ORS  671.560 and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture, to pose an unreasonable risk  of causing  serious  physical  harm  or  damage  to individuals or  property in the  near  future.

2.	Habitability.  A rented space is considered uninhabitable if the landlord does not  maintain a hazard tree required by the 2013 Act. 
 
3.	Resident Duties re Trees Located on Space.  A resident shall maintain and water trees, including cleanup and removal of fallen branches  and leaves, on the  rented space for  a manufactured dwelling except  for  hazard trees. 
•	“Maintaining a  tree”  means removing or  trimming a  tree  for  the  purpose  of eliminating features of the  tree  that  cause the  tree  to  be hazardous, or  that  may  cause  the  tree to become hazardous in  the  near  future. 
•	“Removing a tree”  includes:
o	Felling and  removing the  tree;  and 
o	Grinding or removing the stump of the tree.

4.	Landlord Duties re Hazard Trees. 
•	Landlord shall maintain a hazard tree that  was not  planted by the  current resident if the landlord knows  or should know that  the  tree  is a hazard tree;
•	Landlord may  maintain a tree  on the  rented space to prevent the  tree  from  becoming  a hazard tree;
o	Must provide residents with reasonable written notice and reasonable opportunity to maintain the tree themselves.
•	Landlord has discretion to decide whether the appropriate maintenance of a hazard tree is removal or trimming.
•	Landlord is not responsible for:
o	Maintaining a tree that is not a hazard tree; or
o	Maintaining any tree for aesthetic purposes.
•	A landlord must comply with the access provisions of ORS 90.725 before entering a resident’s space to inspect or maintain a tree. [Generally, 24-hour notice. – PCQ]
•	Subject to the preceding, a resident is responsible for maintaining the non-hazard trees on the resident’s space at the resident’s expense.  
o	The  resident may  retain an  arborist licensed  as a landscape  construction professional pursuant to ORS 671.560 and certified by the International Society  of Arboriculture to inspect a tree  on  the  resident’s  space  at  the  resident’s  expense;
o	If  the  arborist determines that  the  tree  is a hazard, the  resident may:
•	Require the  landlord to  maintain the tree  as a hazard tree;  or
•	Maintain the  tree  at  the  resident’s  expense,  after providing the  landlord with reasonable  written notice  of the  proposed  maintenance and  a copy of the  arborist’s report.

5.	Tree Obstructing Removal of Home From Space. If a manufactured home cannot  be removed  from  a space without first  removing or  trimming a  tree  on  the  space,  the  owner   of  the  home may  remove  or trim the  tree  at  the  owner’s  expense,  after giving  reasonable written  notice  to the landlord, for  the  purpose  of removing the  home.
 
6.	Use of Landscape Professional.  The  landlord or  resident that   is  responsible  for  maintaining  a  tree   must  engage  a landscape  construction professional with  a  valid  landscape license  issued  pursuant to  ORS  671.560  to maintain any  tree  with a DBH  of eight  inches  or  more.

7.	 Access to Resident’s Space [ORS 90.725].
•	An “emergency” includes  but  is not  limited  to:
o	A repair problem that, unless  remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious  physical  harm  or damage  to individuals or property;
o	The presence of a hazard tree on a rented space in a manufactured dwelling park.

•	An “unreasonable time”  refers  to a time  of day,  day  of the  week  or  particular time  that conflicts  with the  resident’s  reasonable and  specific  plans  to use the  space. 
•	 “Yard   maintenance,  equipment  servicing  or  grounds   keeping” includes,   but  is  not limited to, servicing individual septic  tank  systems or  water pumps,  weeding, mowing grass and  pruning trees  and  shrubs.
•	A  landlord   or  a  landlord’s   agent  may  enter  onto  a  rented  space to:
o	Inspect or  maintain trees;
o	A  landlord or  the  landlord’s agent may  enter  a rented space solely  to  inspect  a tree  despite  a denial of consent  by the  resident if  the  landlord or the  landlord’s agent  has given  at least  24 hours’  actual notice  of the  intent to enter  to inspect  the  tree  and  the  entry occurs  at  a reasonable time. 
o	If a landlord has a report from  an  arborist licensed  as a landscape  construction professional  pursuant to ORS 671.560 and  certified by the  International Society  of Arboriculture that  a tree  on the  rented space is a hazard tree  that  must  be maintained by the  landlord under this Act, the  landlord is not  liable  for  any  damage  or injury as a result  of the  hazard tree  if  the  landlord is unable  to gain  entry after making a good faith effort  to do so.
•	If the  resident  refuses  to  allow  lawful   access, the  landlord   may  obtain  injunctive relief to compel access or may  terminate the  rental  agreement  pursuant to ORS 90.630 (1) and  take  possession in  accordance with the Oregon eviction statutes. In addition,   the landlord   may recover actual damages.

8.	Statement of Policy.  It shall include the facility policy regarding the planting of trees on the resident’s rented space.  [See ORS 90.510] 

Conclusion.  It sounds as if your solution was a good one and everyone was satisfied with the outcome.  Your question did not specify whether the tree was a “hazard tree.”  If it was, then my question to you would have been: Did you develop a tree policy for your park?  By the fact that you’re asking this question, I assume you have none.  Even if you did, it would be hard to apply it retroactively.  With the recent snow storms of February, perhaps community owners will become more mindful of these issues.  The first order of business is to take a survey of the hazard trees, and then develop a program for safety maintenance. Lastly, of course, park owners should always have a good policy of liability insurance for $1,000,000 or more that covers this type of situation. Fortunately, no one was injured in your situation, but if so, the solution might not have been so easy.

The purpose is to track down people who might be late on taxes as they are getting returned mail.  Apparently they have called 15 park owners so far seeking this information.
 
I do not know if I am violating any confidentiality or privacy rights of my tenants by providing such information.  Please let me know if it is OK to send them the information.  Park owners and members of MHCO in the county might have the same question.  Thank you.


Answer: Here is § 805(b) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act regarding communication in connection with debt collection. The following activity is prohibited:
 
""Communication with third parties. Subject to limited exceptions, without the prior consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector, or the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, or as reasonably necessary to effectuate a post-judgment judicial remedy, a debt collector may not communicate, in connection with the collection of any debt, with any person other than a consumer, his attorney, a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law, the creditor, the attorney of the creditor, or the attorney of the debt collector.""
 
The Take-Away: This law, when coupled with the general expectation of privacy that residents have, it is my opinion that a landlord should never be in the position of voluntarily disseminating personal contact information to potential creditors, or any other people for that matter – unless the tenant consents in advance.  If the debt collector issues a subpoena, that’s another story.  But until they do, landlords should avoid voluntarily complying with requests for personal information on residents. This applies regardless of whether the third party is a debt collector.

"459","459","3","Delivery and Timing of Legal Notices Under Oregon's Residential-Tenant Law","By:  Phil Querin, Querin Law LLC, MHCO Legal Counsel


The timely delivery of written notices to park residents is essential, especially when they deal with 30-day notices.  Equally important is knowing how to calculate the applicable time periods. Here is a short primer on the current Oregon law.

How to serve a written notice: There are three acceptable methods:

 	(1) Personal delivery;
      	(2) First class mail; or
     	(3) Only it the lease/rental agreement permits for both landlord and tenant, either party may use “nail and mail.”  This allows a written notice to be sent from the landlord to the tenant by first class mail addressed to the tenant at the premises and a copy of the notice to be attached in a secure manner to the main entrance to that portion of the premises; and

Calculating the notice periods. Here are the rules:

(1) Where the time for compliance is measured in days, they are calculated by consecutive calendar days, not including the initial day of service, but including the last day until 12 Midnight of the last day. 
(2) Where the time for compliance is measured in hours, they are calculated in consecutive clock hours, beginning immediately upon service.
(3) When “nail and mail” is used for a 72-hour or 144-hour nonpayment notice, the time period for compliance begins at 11:59 p.m. the day the notice is both mailed and attached to the premises. The time period ends 72 hours or 144 hours, as the case may be, after the time started to run at 11:59 p.m. on the day of mailing.

Practice Tips.  After more than a few years in this business, I’ve accumulated some rules of thumb. They may not be for everyone, but they generally work for me.  My approach is to assume that Murphy’s Law is ever-present, so I err on the side of being too cautious.
(1)	When calculating days or hours, always add a few extra just to be safe.  Just because it’s called a “72-hour notice,” doesn’t mean you can’t add a few more hours. Same for 24-hour notices.
(2)	Don’t forget the additional 3-day period for mailing. It applies to virtually all written notices you give, from 30-day notices, to park closure notices.  I frequently add five days rather than three.
(3)	 If you’re going to serve a written notice personally, take a witness, just to avoid the possibility of the resident denying service. If someone other than the tenant comes to the door, I’d think twice about making “substituted service,” as it’s too easy for the person answering to “forget,” and you’ve now got an issue you could have avoided. I suggest finding out when the resident is returning, and come back. Never deliver the notice to a child or teenager – for obvious reasons. If they won’t answer the door, don’t think you can slip it under the door, behind the screen, or drop it in an open window.  Just go back to the office and mail it via regular mail.
(4)	Never, never, never use certified mail or any other form of delivery like UPS or Fed Ex. Always use regular first class mail.
(5)	Remember, if the written notice is properly addressed, stamped and posted, the law “presumes” receipt. While the resident can try to deny it, the “presumption” requires them to prove a reason for non-receipt, which is pretty difficult to do. I’ve never seen the argument work.   A good precaution is to obtain a certificate of mailing from the post office, which confirms that you posted the letter.
(6)	I’m not a fan of nail and mail. Unless your rental agreement permits it both ways, i.e. from landlord to tenant, and vice versa,  you should not use this method. If you’re insistent on using this method, don’t forget the 11:59 PM rule.
(7)	 Don’t forget to keep true copies of the notice.  You’ll have to attach it to eviction complaint, if the matter isn’t resolved by the notice.
(8)	“Measure twice, cut once.” In other words, calculate the number of days or hours a couple of time, just to make sure you’ve got the proper amount of time. Have someone else review it, just to make sure.

"469","469","3","Phil Querin Q&A Selling New Manufactured Home for Community Sales","Question.  As a park, we would like to purchase new manufactured homes to fill vacant lots.  We would purchase them from the manufacturer, set them up, and probably list them through a real estate agent for the marketing.  We would not handle the financing, especially under the complicated Dodd-Frank stuff, which would require the prospective purchaser to seek their own means of coming up with the funds to make the purchase.  We would not “carry the paper.”  We assume that the real estate people are either MLO's themselves, or can point a prospective purchaser into the direction of a MLO. At this point, we believe that we have the financial portion on our side figured out, but run into a couple of legal questions that you may be able to help us with.
 
Today, I contacted the Oregon Division of Finance & Corporate Securities asking what type of Manufactured Structures Dealer (“MSD”) license we would need to purchase new homes from a dealer and resell them within our park.  He explained that the Limited MSD license would suffice.  I told him that I had read that the limited MSD license authorized the selling of no more than 10 pre-owned manufactured structures during a calendar year, and that my understanding is only abandoned structures and dwellings purchased by the licensee and sited at the licensee’s park at the time of sale fit under the LMSD license.  I asked him if the sale of the structure “sited in the park” meant that when the park owner re-sold the unit the home was required to be sited in the park, or when the park owner purchased the home from the manufacturer the home needed to be already within the park.  He told me that that was a good question that no one had asked before but still felt that a LMSD license would be okay. 
 
Upon further checking I see that a MSD (not a Limited MSD) allows a business holding that license to sell new and used manufactured structures.  Our questions are as follows:
•	What type of a Manufactured Structure License would we need to sell new homes that we have purchased from a dealership or manufacturer? 
•	 Can we as park even hold a MSD License? 
•	Would our idea of placing the marketing of the home into the hands of a real estate agent release us from having to become or hire an independent MLO? 

Answer:  The following answers should not be regarded as “legal advice” since this column is intended to be purely educational and for general information purposes. You need to consult your own attorney for a legal opinion.   

•	You are correct about the law; the limited dealer’s license is just for park owners with abandoned homes.  There is no provision for dealers with a limited license to sell new homes. According to the law, you need a regular dealer’s license. See, ORS 446.696,  446.701  and 446.706. 
•	I am troubled that the DFCS said they thought it was OK for you to sell new homes under a limited license, since limited licenses are for abandoned homes which are (presumably) pre-owned.  Having said that, if you wanted to proceed on the DFCS’s advice, I suspect that if some official later objected, they would have a hard time taking any punitive measures you’re your noncompliance.  Of course, you never know. The IRS gives out information all the time, and following their advice is no defense to a violation.  Why don’t you ask if they will put their verbal statement in writing?
•	I agree that the law says a dealer under a regular license (as opposed to a limited license) may sell new and used homes (so long as he/she discloses that they will sell used homes in the application). 
•	Note that you do not need a MLO license to sell homes. You may use a real estate broker to list and sell your new homes.  The fact that they are sited at your park and later sold does not make them “resales.”  However, to offer or negotiate the financing terms of a purchase money loan, you would need the services of an Oregon licensed MLO (i.e.  a mortgage broker or mortgage banker). The real estate brokers can handle the transaction, write it up, etc., but cannot advertise or negotiate specific financial terms were you to carry the paper. 
•	However, if you are going to require that the buyers secure their own financing (i.e. you are not going to “carry the paper”), I see no reason that you need to worry about MLOs, since you will be selling for cash.  You will not be taking payments over time.  It will be the buyer’s lender who will be acting as the MLO (i.e. the mortgage broker or mortgage banker), and negotiating the terms of the purchase money loan to the buyer.  
•	My reading of Oregon administrative rule 441-446-0203 prohibits dealers from acquiring an ownership interest in a park only appears to apply if you are going to offer or negotiate the terms of a residential mortgage loan, i.e. engage in MLO activities or are doing so under an exemption under the MLO laws. Since buyer financing is going to occur via third-party lenders, I do not believe you are prohibited as a “dealer” from owning an interest in a manufactured housing community. 
•	From my perspective, you would be much safer to have someone with a full dealer’s license handle the sales program. The real estate licensee can list the homes, find the buyers, write up the transactions (making them subject to third-party financing, etc.). The dealer can handle the transaction from there. 

Footnotes:

Footnote 1:  446.696 Renewal of dealer license. A manufactured structure dealer license is valid for three years, but the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may adjust the term of an initial license for the purpose of establishing uniform expiration dates. A dealer may renew a license as provided by the director. The director may renew a license only if the dealer:
      (1) Delivers to the director a bond or letter of credit that meets the requirements under ORS 446.726.
      (2) Provides evidence acceptable to the director that the dealer obtained a corporate surety bond as provided in ORS 86A.227 if the dealer employs or intends to employ a mortgage loan originator, as defined in ORS 86A.200, or is otherwise subject to ORS 86A.200 to 86A.239.
      (3) Certifies to the director in a form and manner the director specifies by rule that the dealer has independently verified that every individual the dealer hired or intends to hire as a mortgage loan originator meets the requirements set forth in ORS 86A.200 to 86A.239 and in ORS 86A.186.
      (4) Pays the fee specified in ORS 446.721 for renewal of a manufactured structure dealer license.
      (5) Submits a completed application for renewal in a form approved by the director that includes:
      (a) The name and residence address of the dealer. If the dealer is a firm or partnership, the application must include the names and addresses of the members of the firm or partnership. If the dealer is a corporation, the application must include the names and addresses of the principal officers of the corporation and the name of the state in which the corporation is incorporated.
      (b) The name under which the business will be conducted.
      (c) The street address, including city and county in Oregon, where the business will be conducted.
      (d) If the location of the dealership is being changed at the time of renewal:
      (A) For a business that will be conducted in a residential zone, a statement by the dealer that all manufactured structures sold or displayed at that address will meet any architectural and aesthetic standards regulating the placement of manufactured structures in that residential zone.
      (B) For a business that will offer for sale new manufactured structures that are recreational vehicles greater than eight and one-half feet in width, a certificate from the applicant stating that the applicant will maintain a recreational vehicle service facility for those recreational vehicles at a street address provided in the application.
      (e) Information the director requires to efficiently regulate manufactured structure dealers and dealerships or other relevant information the director requires. [2003 c.655 §29; 2009 c.863 §30]
  
Footnote 2: 446.701 Issuance of temporary manufactured structure dealer license. (1) If a licensed manufactured structure dealer dies or becomes incapacitated, the Department of Consumer and Business Services may issue a temporary manufactured structure dealer license to the executor, administrator or personal representative of the estate of the dealer or to an agent of the dealer approved by the department. A temporary license issued under this subsection expires after six months, but the department may extend the license for good cause. The department may not extend a temporary license if the license has been suspended or the licensee placed on probation by the department.
      (2) A person issued a temporary manufactured structure dealer license must deliver to the department a bond or letter of credit that meets the requirements under ORS 446.726. A bond or letter of credit covering a license term of less than one year must be for the sum otherwise required for each year a license is valid and must be renewed if the term is extended. The temporary manufactured structure dealer is responsible for ensuring that, during the term of the temporary license, the dealership and its employees comply with ORS 446.661 to 446.756. and rules adopted thereunder. This subsection does not relieve a manufactured structure dealer licensed under ORS 446.691 or 446.696 from liability for a violation arising out of actions or omissions by the dealer.
      (3) Notwithstanding ORS 446.731:
      (a) Issuance of a temporary manufactured structure dealer license does not, by itself, affect the rights or interests of any creditors of the dealer in dealership assets or inventory.
      (b) Issuance or expiration of a temporary license is not a transfer of interest for purposes of ORS 446.736.
      (4) A person obtaining a temporary manufactured structure dealer license must pay the applicable fee specified in ORS 446.721 for issuance of a temporary manufactured structure dealer license. [2003 c.655 §29a]
 
Footnote 3: 446.706 Limited manufactured structure dealer; licensing. (1) A person who holds a limited manufactured structure dealer license issued under this section may sell during a calendar year up to 10 manufactured dwellings located at a manufactured dwelling park identified in the license. The manufactured dwellings sold under a limited manufactured structure dealer license must be dwellings that:
      (a) Have been abandoned as described in ORS 90.675 at any manufactured dwelling park. If the manufactured dwelling is not subject to sale by the limited manufactured structure dealer under ORS 90.675 (10), the dealer must have the certificate of title or registration for the dwelling transferred to the dealer prior to offering the dwelling for sale; or
      (b) Have been purchased by the park owner from a person holding title, and at the time of purchase by the park owner, were sited in the manufactured dwelling park identified in the license.
      (2) Notwithstanding ORS 90.525, if a limited manufactured structure dealer sells a manufactured dwelling that was abandoned at a manufactured dwelling park other than the park where the dwelling is being sold, the sale terms for the manufactured dwelling must require that the dwelling is to be sited under a rental agreement at the park where sold for at least 12 months following the sale.
      (3) Except as provided in ORS 446.741, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall issue a limited manufactured structure dealer license to a person if the person:

"472","472","3","Phil Querin Q&A Temporary Occupant Stealing Electrical Power","Question:  The owner of a manufactured home community discovers that a temporary occupant in his community is stealing electrical power.  PGE and the Portland Police have been out to the community and investigated the theft.  He is also growing marijuana in the home but has a medical marijuana card.  What notices does the landlord serve this household keeping in mind that he is the temporary occupant?  Who does the notice go to, the occupant or the resident or both?  The resident, who is the occupant’s mother, shows no inclination to deal with this problem.

Answer: Assuming that the landlord has a temporary occupancy agreement in place, the answers are found in ORS 90.275 (Temporary occupancy agreement; terms and conditions). Specifically:
•	The temporary occupancy agreement is between the landlord, tenant and temporary occupant – all must sign.
•	The temporary occupant does not have the same rights as a tenant under the landlord-tenant law.
•	One may terminate the temporary occupancy agreement as follows:
o	Only for cause that is a material violation of the temporary occupancy agreement ; presumably the theft constitutes a material violation under your rules and regulations which the temporary occupant is required to comply with; it is certainly a violation of law, which would suffice.
o	The temporary occupant does not have a right to cure the violation;
o	Legally, you do not have to give written notice of termination to the temporary occupant.  However, in this case, I would do so, just for the record, and to make it clear that a notice of termination was, in fact, given.
o	The temporary occupant is required to “promptly vacate” upon receipt of the notice.  I suggest you give him/her a couple of days, just to avoid an issue.
o	Although the statute doesn’t expressly require it, I would copy the resident on the notice.  

•	If, after you give the notice, the temporary occupant sneaks back in the evenings, as seems to occur frequently, you should give the temporary occupant a formal “No Trespassing” letter, with a copy to the resident.  It would be preferable if you had these notices personally delivered if you can.  Then if the temporary occupant comes back, you may call the police to have him/her removed.

•	Alternatively, except as provided in ORS 90.449 (the statute protecting victims of domestic violence), a landlord may terminate the tenancy of the resident under ORS 90.630 (the statute permitting for-cause terminations) if the temporary occupant fails to promptly vacate the dwelling, or if the resident materially violates the temporary occupancy agreement.
•	A temporary occupant shall be treated as a squatter if he/she continues to occupy the dwelling unit after you have terminated the temporary occupancy agreement.
o	ORS 90.100 (41) defines a squatter as “a person occupying a dwelling unit who is not so entitled under a rental agreement or who is not authorized by the tenant to occupy that dwelling unit.” 
o	The landlord-tenant statutes do not have a specific provision dealing with eviction of “squatters.” Although it implies you could have them forcefully removed, I would not attempt any self-help remedies.  Rather, you could simply file an eviction, attach a copy of the termination notice, and proceed from there. Alternatively, you could proceed against the temporary occupant and the mother, if she did nothing to make sure he was out. If all else fails, I prefer the former approach, since frequently, a parent - especially an aged parent – is simply not capable of insisting that the son/daughter leave, and I don’t believe that failure alone, should result in them losing their right to remain in the community.

•	Before entering into a temporary occupancy agreement, the law permits landlords to screen the proposed temporary occupant for issues regarding conduct or for a criminal record.  If that was not done in this instance it should have been. (Note that a landlord may not screen the proposed temporary occupant for credit history or income level.)

Lastly, I see no significance in the temporary occupant having a marijuana card. It isn’t a license to steal.

"476","476","3","Phil Querin Q&A Billing Back Sewer Charges to Residents","Question:  Our park does not have individual meters and at this point both the water and sewer on included in the monthly rent charge. Is there a method for billing back the sewer charges (no water) to the residents?  

Answer: Sewer changes are considered a utility. ORS 90.532 (“Billing methods for utility or service charges”) provides that, subject to certain exceptions, landlords may provide for utilities or services to tenants by one or more of several alternative billing methods, depending upon the billing “relationship” between landlord and tenant:

1.	A relationship between the tenant and the utility or service provider in which the utility provider provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space, including any utility or service line, and bills the tenant directly; and the landlord does not act as a provider.
2.	A relationship between the landlord, tenant and utility or service provider in which the utility provider provides the utility or service to the landlord; the landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space (or to a common area); and (a) the landlord: includes the cost of the utility or service in the tenant’s rent; or (b) bills the tenant for the utility or service charge separately from the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the provider’s charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter.
3.	And lastly, a relationship between the landlord, tenant and utility or service provider in which the utility provider provides the utility or service to the landlord, the landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space; and the landlord uses a submeter to measure the utility or service actually provided to the space and bills the tenant for a utility or service charge for the amount provided.

It appears that No. 2(a) above may currently apply to your situation. In order to “charge back” the residents, I assume you mean charge them directly (outside the base rent) for the cost of the sewer service. Thus, what I understand you to be asking, is whether you can “convert” from 2(a) to 2(b).  If your current sewer service is measured by water consumption, and your intent is to separately charge residents a pro rata basis calculated by a master water meter, then ORS 90.532(2(c) applies, which provides that a landlord may not use a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for sewer service, if sewer service is measured by consumption of water and the rental agreement was entered into on or after January 1, 2010, unless the landlord was using a separately charged pro rata apportionment billing method for all tenants in the facility immediately before January 1, 2010.

By your question, it appears that sewer and water are both included in base rent, at present.  Thus, the prorata method (i.e. direct billing for sewer charges outside of base rent) would only be allowed if you already had it in place for all residents prior to January 1, 2010.  

Unfortunately, it appears that unless you begin submetering your water, you will be unable to separately charge for sewer on a prorata basis outside of your base rent.

Understanding the requirements for the sale of homes inside a manufactured housing community is important for residents and landlords, alike.  If the procedures are followed by both sides, the transfer of ownership can be smooth.  However, if either side fails to abide by the law, the rental agreement or the community's rules, problems can occur.  Here are some general guidelines to follow when a resident wants to sell their home and have the new buyer approved for occupancy in the community :

•	A landlord may not prohibit the resident from selling their home to a qualified buyer who wants to apply to remain in the community.   Conversely, the landlord may not require a resident to remove the home from the space solely because they have placed it up for sale.

•	A landlord may not charge a commission or fee for the sale of the home.  The only exception is if the landlord is acting as an agent for the seller pursuant to written contract.

•	The landlord may not prohibit the placement of ""for sale"" signs on or in the resident's home. However, the size, placement and character of signs are subject to reasonable rules of the landlord.

Tenant Duties/Obligations

•	The resident must give not more than 10 days' written notice prior to the sale of the home.

•	Prior to the sale, the prospective purchaser must submit a complete and accurate written application for occupancy; they may not occupy the home until after they have been approved by the landlord.  

•	The resident must give notice to any lienholder, prospective purchaser or person licensed to sell manufactured homes, of the location of all properly functioning smoke alarms and any other community rules and regulations.

•	That the prospective purchaser pay in full all rents, fees, deposits or charges owed by the resident prior to the landlord's acceptance of the prospective purchaser as a new resident. However, this  requirement  does not  apply  if  the  sale  is  by  the  home's lienholder. The landlord may also require that the resident give this information to any lienholder, prospective purchaser or person licensed to sell manufactured homes.


Landlord Duties/Obligations

•	At the time the landlord gives the prospective purchaser an application for occupancy, the landlord shall also provide copies of  the  statement  of  policy (“SOP”), the rental agreement  and the rules and regulations, as well  as any  conditions imposed  on  a subsequent  resale of the home.  Note: The terms of the SOP, rental agreement and rules and regulations do not need to be the same as those applicable to the selling resident's documents.

•	The landlord must accept or reject the application within 7 days following the day the landlord receives a complete and accurate written application. 

o	Note: If the resident has not previously given the landlord the required 10 days' notice before putting the home up for sale pursuant to ORS 90.680(4)(a), the 7-day period to accept or reject is extended to 10 days.
o	Note: The landlord and prospective purchaser may agree to a longer time for the landlord to evaluate the application information or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord’s screening criteria.  [Caution: Such an extension of time should always be in writing and signed by the prospective applicant.]

•	Note: An  application  is  not  complete  until  the  prospective  purchaser  pays  the  required applicant screening charge and provides the landlord with all information and documentation, including any financial data and references, required in by the landlord. 

•	A landlord may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant. Reasonable cause for rejection includes, but is not limited to, failure of the prospective purchaser to meet the landlords conditions for approval as provided in ORS 90.510 (Statement of policy) (5)(h) or failure of the prospective purchasers references to respond to the landlord’s timely request for verification within the time allowed for acceptance or rejection. 

•	The  landlord  must  furnish  the  seller and  prospective purchaser  with  a  written statement of the  reasons for the rejection.   However, if the rejection is based on a consumer report, the landlord may not disclose the contents of the report to anyone other than the purchaser. The landlord shall disclose to the seller in writing  that the rejection  is  based upon information  contained in  a  consumer  report  and  that  the landlord may not disclose the information contained in that report.

•	If the landlord does not require a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy in the community, or if the landlord does not accept or reject the prospective purchaser within the time required:	
o 	The landlord waives the right to bring an action against the existing resident for breach
of the rental agreement's resale requirements.
o 	Upon completion of the sale, the prospective purchaser may occupy the home as a legal resident under the same conditions [i.e. SOP, rental agreement and rules] imposed upon the existing resident who sold the home.
o 		Unless the new resident otherwise agrees in writing, the landlord may not impose any new conditions on the tenancy beyond those contained in the selling resident's rental agreement.

•	A landlord may not, because of the age, size, style or original construction material of the home [or because the home was built prior to adoption of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 5403], in compliance with the standards of that Act in effect at that time or in compliance with the state building code as defined in ORS 455.010 (Definitions for ORS chapter 455)]:
o	Reject an application for tenancy; or
o	Require a prospective purchaser of an existing home to remove it from the rented space.

•	Note:  If a resident who has received a 30-day notice for repair or deterioration under ORS 90.632 attempts to sell their home without making the corrections contained in the notice, they must provide a copy of the notice to that buyer prior to the closing of the sale. Alternatively, the landlord may provide the buyer with a copy of the notice. The landlord may require, as a condition of approval, that the purchaser comply with the notice within the time set forth in the notice. If the tenancy has been terminated under the notice, the prospective purchaser does not have a right to leave the home in the park.
 

•	If the home is the subject of an active abandonment initiated by the landlord under ORS 90.675, the resident has the right to sell it to a park-approved purchaser under substantially the same conditions as would be imposed on a lienholder in such circumstances.1

"480","480","3","Phil Querin Q&A Is Domestic Violence a Defense to Non-Payment of Rent?","Question:  I have a tenant that I issued a 72 Hour Non-Payment of Rent notice to last month. When I served it she told me that she is a victim of domestic violence and would provide me a copy of the restraining order, she also told me that she would have her attorney contact me. Neither occurred. She paid her rent by the final date on the notice. She hasn't paid rent yet this month. I still have no copies of a restraining order, nor has her husband informed me that he has moved out. She is the only one to tell me about domestic violence. I just served her with another 72 hour notice. She is upset and yelled that I can't evict her because she is still dealing with issues as a victim of domestic violence. She also told me that she now has two attorneys and that she will have them both call me. I informed her to read the notice carefully as rent will need to be paid by the 13th or I would file in court on the 14th.
My question is this: Is domestic violence a recognized defense to non-payment of rent?

Answer: Domestic violence is a defense to eviction, but only under the proper circumstances.  I have set out the law in its entirety below. As you can see, the law presumes there has been a violent act for which the landlord is evicting everyone in the space, i.e. the villain and the victim.  The domestic violence law says you cannot evict the victim for the violent act. But it also says the villain and the victim are still responsible for rent.  It also requires a valid third-party affirmation to the event.  

In short, based on your question, it does not sound as if the domestic violence statute will provide a defense to an action for nonpayment of rent.  You should tell the victim that you do not believe the domestic violence law applies in these circumstances (i.e. nonpayment of rent) and that if her attorney believes otherwise, he must call you immediately and explain why. Is she is a serial late pay for which you have to issue multiple non-payment of rent notices, you might consider a 3-strikes notice under ORS 90.630(8).

They have since divorced and one of them has moved out. They qualified for occupancy based upon their joint income. The party retaining possession would clearly not qualify today. How do we deal with this?  Here are my questions:

1. Do we write a new lease for the remaining resident or keep the old lease with both residents on the lease? 

A new lease would presumably require than any new occupants be qualified all over again. But the current occupant would not qualify.  Secondly, the ex-spouse would have no liability for space rent going forward.  You may want to leave the status quo, to keep your options opened.

2. Can we legally keep the resident that moved out, responsible for the lease after a divorce and separation of assets?  Yes.

3. Do we re-screen the remaining resident to see if he/she qualifies on their own?  

I have a concern about doing so – if they did not pass the credit requirements, then what?  You can’t evict them without cause, and as long as the remaining occupant is current, you could not do so.  Besides, if the remaining occupant is receiving spousal or child support, their income might be sufficient.

4. Who owns the security deposit or pre-paid rent?  

I don’t think you have a duty to refund any deposits until the tenancy is ended, and so far, that isn’t the case. If and when it is ended, you could ask for joint instructions from both of them, and if they can’t agree, make the check out to them jointly.

She says they are coming from the ground around the home and has had an exterminator out who confirms that the infestation is coming from the ground.  The resident demands that we pay for the exterminator and that the infestation be controlled at the expense of management. WE do not believe it is our responsibility.  What are your thoughts?

Answer:  As to whether you or the resident is responsible for the condition of the ground upon which the home sits, it depends on whether the infestation existed at the time of commencement of the tenancy. If “yes,” the it’s your responsibility to abate; if “no” then it’s the tenant’s responsibility.  Here is a summary of the applicable statute.  I have highlighted that portion of the law which applies to your issue:

ORS 90.730 [Landlord duty to maintain rented space, vacant spaces and common areas in habitable condition.] provides in relevant part:

•	A landlord who rents a space for a manufactured dwelling shall at all times during the tenancy maintain the rented space, vacant spaces in the facility and the facility common areas in a habitable condition.
•	The landlord does not have a duty to maintain a dwelling or home.
•	A landlord’s habitability duty includes only the following:
o	A sewage disposal system and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the sewage disposal system can be controlled by the landlord;
o	If required by applicable law, a drainage system reasonably capable of disposing of storm water, ground water and subsurface water, approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order;
o	A water supply and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained so as to provide safe drinking water and to be in good working order to the extent that the water supply system can be controlled by the landlord;
o	An electrical supply and a connection to the space approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the electrical supply system can be controlled by the landlord;
o	At the time of commencement of the rental agreement, buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin;
o	Except as otherwise provided by local ordinance or by written agreement between the landlord and the tenant, an adequate number of appropriate receptacles for garbage and rubbish in clean condition and good repair at the time of commencement of the rental agreement, and for which the landlord shall provide and maintain appropriate serviceable receptacles thereafter and arrange for their removal; and
o	Completion of any landlord-provided space improvements, including but not limited to installation of carports, garages, driveways and sidewalks, approved under applicable law at the time of installation.
•	 A rented space is considered unhabitable if the landlord does not maintain a hazard tree as required by ORS 90.727. 
•	A vacant space in a facility is considered unhabitable if the space substantially lacks safety from the hazards of fire or injury.
•	A facility common area is considered unhabitable if it substantially lacks:
o	 Buildings, grounds and appurtenances that are kept in every part safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses, clean, sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and vermin;
o	Safety from the hazards of fire;
o	Trees, shrubbery and grass maintained in a safe manner; and 
o	If supplied or required to be supplied by the landlord to a common area, a water supply system, sewage disposal system or system for disposing of storm water, ground water and subsurface water approved under applicable law at the time of installation and maintained in good working order to the extent that the system can be controlled by the landlord.
•	 Note that the landlord and tenant may agree in writing that the tenant is to perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks and minor remodeling only if:
o	The agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord;
o	The agreement does not diminish the obligations of the landlord to other tenants on the premises; and 
o	The terms and conditions of the agreement are clearly and fairly disclosed and adequate consideration for the agreement is specifically stated.  

The term “vermin” is defined as:  “Small insects and animals (such as fleas or mice) that are sometimes harmful to plants or other animals and that are difficult to get rid of.” [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vermin] That’s a pretty broad definition, and I’m going to assume that “vermin” include ants.  So the question is, was this condition one that existed at the commencement of the tenancy?  If the resident had been at the space for years and never complained until now, I suspect they [or their exterminator] would have a tough time establishing when the problem first occurred.  As you know, pests come and go; they could be seasonal, weather related, food related, hygiene related, etc.

Chances are that if one resident has ants, others may as well.  Had the resident come to you before hiring the exterminator, I would have suggested that you find out how widespread the problem was, and if it was prevalent throughout the community [or a specific area within the community] perhaps work out some cost-sharing arrangement along with a periodic maintenance schedule to eradicate the problem. That was not done here.   

However, good community relations suggests that you find out the breadth of the problem, and if it affects several residents, discuss a solution with all of them that works for your pocketbook, and the residents’ budget. Whether you pay for the exterminator for one resident, might set a bad precedent, since it could encourage others to do the same.  That’s why you want to find out the scope of the problem.

"494","494","3","Phil Querin Q&A Fees Against Tenants Who Violate the Rules","Question: I understand that the Oregon statutes now permit landlords to levy fines against tenants who
violate the rules. Where is the statute and what does it say?

Answer: The statute you are referring to is 90.302, and it provides the following:

• A landlord may charge a tenant a fee for each occurrence of the following:
o A late rent payment;
o A dishonored check;
o Removal or tampering with a properly functioning smoke alarm,smoke detector or
carbon monoxide alarm;
o The violation of a written pet agreement or of a rule relating to pets in a facility;
o The abandonment or relinquishment of a dwelling unit during a fixed term tenancy
without cause;
• A landlord may charge a tenant a fee for a second noncompliance or for a subsequent
noncompliance with written rules or policies that describe the prohibited conduct and the fee for a second noncompliance, and for any third or subsequent noncompliance, that occurs within one year after a written warning notice.
o The fee may not exceed $50 for the second noncompliance within one year after the warning notice for the same or a similar noncompliance or
o $50 plus five percent of the rent payment for the current rental period for a third or subsequent noncompliance within one year after the warning notice for the same or a similar noncompliance.
• The landlord must:
o Give the tenant a written warning notice that describes:
 A specific noncompliance before charging a fee for a second or subsequent
noncompliance for the same or similar conduct; and
 The amount of the fee for a second noncompliance, and for any subsequent
noncompliance, that occurs within one year after the warning notice. Give a tenant a written notice describing the noncompliance when assessing a fee for a second or subsequent noncompliance that occurs within one year after the warning notice. Give a warning notice for a noncompliance or assess a fee for a second or subsequent noncompliance within 30 days after the act constituting noncompliance.
• The landlord may terminate a tenancy for a noncompliance instead of assessing a fee, but may not assess a fee and terminate a tenancy for the same noncompliance.
• The landlord may not deduct a fee from a rent payment for the current or a subsequent rental period.
• The landlord may charge a tenant a fee for occurrences of noncompliance with written rules or policies as provided above for the following types of noncompliance:
o The late payment to futility or service charge that the tenant owes the landlord; 
o The failure to clean up pet waste from the space;
o The failure to clean up garbage,rubbish and other waste from the space;
o For parking violations;
o For the improper use of vehicles within the premises;
o For smoking in a clearly designated nonsmoking area within the community other than
the home;
1
o For keeping an unauthorized pet capable of causing damage to persons or property.
• The landlord is not be required to account for or return to any fees to the tenant.
• Other than for early termination of a fixed term lease (discussed above) a landlord may not
charge a tenant any form of liquidated damages, however designated.
• Nonpayment of a fee is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent (i.e. under ORS 90.394), but is grounds for a 30-day notice of termination for cause under
90.630 (1).
• This law does not apply to:
o Attorneyfeesawarded;
o Applicant screening charges;
o Charges for improvements or other actions that are requested by the tenant and are not
required under the rental agreement or by law, including the cost to replace a key lost
by a tenant;
o Processing fees charged to the landlord by a credit card company and passed through to
the tenant for the use of a credit card by the tenant to make a payment when:
 The credit card company allows processing fees to be passed through to the
credit card holder; and
 The landlord allows the tenant to pay in cash or by check; or
 A requirement by a landlord in a written rental agreement that a tenant obtain
and maintain renter’s liability insurance.
• NOTE: The fees must be described in a written rental agreement.
o Since ORS90.100(38)defines“rental agreement”to mean“…all agreements,written or oral, and valid rules and regulations, it would seem that including the fines in the rules would suffice.

One toke over the line
Sittin' downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line” ~ Brewer & Shipley, 1971.

Background. Landlords in Oregon are understandably flummoxed by the new prescription drug du jour, medical marijuana.  Why? Because, while Oregon permits the medical use of marijuana, the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801, et seq., says that it is illegal to manufacture, distribute, and possess marijuana, even when state law authorizes its use. Furthermore, federal law supersedes state law where there is a direct conflict between them.  So, what does a landlord do when confronted by a card-carrying tenant claiming that he/she cannot be evicted for marijuana use and/or cultivation, because they have a legal right to do so under Oregon law.  To second arrow in the tenant’s quiver is the threat that “if you try to evict me, I will sue you under the federal Fair Housing laws  that say you must grant me a reasonable accommodation  [i.e. let me toke on the premises] because I have a “disability.”  

Discussion. Clearly, this is a very complicated issue on several levels.  Marijuana is a controlled substance under Federal Law, but under Oregon law, its use and cultivation in limited amounts are lawful with a medical marijuana card. The Oregon laws cover such things as grow-site registration; medical uses for marijuana; issuance of an identification card; and limitations on a cardholder’s immunity from criminal laws involving marijuana.  For those interested, the specific statutes should be consulted here. 

Based upon recent news reports, it appears that, subject to certain exceptions,  there will be no effort by the federal Department of Justice to seek out and charge violators of the Controlled Substances Act in those states where the medical or recreational use of marijuana are legal.

The Conundrum.  In short, it appears that when it comes to enforcement of their rules and regulations, Oregon landlords are on their own; neither the feds, nor the state, will go after persons with lawfully issued medical marijuana cards. Furthermore, if a tenant has a valid card, then arguably he or she has some medical condition that has authorized its issuance. Is the landlord obligated under the Fair Housing laws to make a “reasonable accommodation” for their medical condition, and permit the tenant to continue their use or grow operation?   If properly done, the answer may be “No.” Here’s  why: 

In January 20, 2011, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) issued a Memorandum, the subject of which was “Medical Use of Marijuana and Reasonable Accommodation in Federal Public and Assisted Housing.” While the Memo was limited to federal public and assisted housing, it can be regarded as a helpful – though perhaps not a “final” resource – on the issue.   It is very complete and helpful for all landlords. It can be found at this link. Here is what the Memo directs:

Public housing agencies “…in states that have enacted laws legalizing the use of medical marijuana must therefore establish a standard and adopt written policy regarding whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance for residents who are medical marijuana users.  The decision of whether or not to allow continued occupancy or assistance to medical marijuana users is the responsibility of PHAs, not of the Department.” 

Thus, HUD appears to be leaving it up to the state public housing authorities to decide whether the refusal to permit on-premises use of medical marijuana constitutes a fair housing violation. Between the lines, it appears that HUD will not directly investigate such claims, leaving it up to public housing agencies on the state level.  

While HUD’s pronouncement is directed toward “public housing” is would be hard to believe private housing would be treated any differently.  Oregon fair housing law is ""substantially equivalent"" to federal fair housing law.  So, generally speaking, on the issue of medical marijuana, as goes the federal law, so goes state law.  

However, in the 2010 case of Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, the Oregon Supreme Court held that employers do not have a legal  duty to allow employees to use medical marijuana on the job.  This case addressed many unanswered questions on the use of medical marijuana in Oregon, both from an employment and housing perspective. Additionally, a subsequent article [found here] by the Fair Housing Council of Oregon is helpful for landlords from the view of private fair housing enforcement. 

Thus, it appears that in Oregon, on both the federal and state levels, enforcement agencies are [for the time being at least] taking a laissez-faire approach to the medical marijuana issue. This means that landlords have it within their control, with little fear of a fair housing/reasonable accommodation claim, to enact rules and regulations prohibiting the on-premises use of medical marijuana. However, the proscription should not be retroactive to tenants holding legal medical marijuana cards who have already signed their rental agreements or leases.  
Oregon Landlord-Tenant Laws.  Oregon statutes permit landlords to enforce tenant violations of their rental agreements, rules, and general laws [not just the landlord-tenant laws]. It is my belief that the violation of a no medical marijuana policy would be enforceable on a going forward basis. The policy should not be retroactive – and it should so state.

In summary,  ORS 90.630 [Termination by Landlord] provides as follow:

•	After delivery of written notice, a landlord may terminate the rental agreement for cause and take possession in accordance with the state eviction laws [ORS 105.105 to 105.168], unless the tenant cures the violation.
•	Causes for termination are:
o	Material violations of the rental agreement;
o	Material violation by the tenant of his/her legal duties under [ORS 90.740];
o	Failure to pay rent.
•	The landlord’s notice to the tenant must:
o	Specify the acts and omissions constituting the violation;
o	State that the rental agreement will terminate upon a designated date not less than 30 days after delivery of the notice; and 
o	If the violation may be cured under the law, so state and describe at least one possible remedy to cure it, designating the date by which the cure must occur.
•	If the violation described in the notice can be cured, and is cured by the designated date, the tenancy will not terminate; 
•	 If the tenant does not cure the violation, the rental agreement terminates as provided in the notice. 
•	If the cause of a written notice relates to substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior violation for which notice was given within the previous six months, the designated termination date must be not less than 20 days after delivery of the notice and no earlier than the designated termination date stated in the previously given notice. The tenant does not have a right to cure this subsequent violation. 

Miscellaneous Tips.  Landlords, read the medical marijuana card!   It must valid and current for Oregon.  A California card, for example, would not suffice.  [See, State v. Berrenger, 2010]. If there is no card, or no current card, the growing [not use] of marijuana may still be a violation of Oregon law.  In such cases, issuance of a curable 30-day notice under ORS 90.630 may be appropriate. If other tenants are complaining about the odor [and many do], a landlord may consider looking to the “quiet enjoyment” provisions of the rental agreement, the rules, or the provisions in ORS 90.740(4)(i). 

Conclusion. Rental management companies and individual landlords in Oregon may wish to institute a written medical marijuana policy in their rules and/or rental agreements, dealing both with use and cultivation. Based upon current federal law, it does not appear to be a fair housing violation to prohibit medical marijuana in the landlord’s rental agreement or rules. If such a policy exists, it should include management’s right to decline a request for a reasonable accommodation.  


Remember, besides nonpayment of rent, there are only three ways to terminate a tenancy for cause: 
•	Violation of the rental/lease agreement; 
•	Violation of the rules; and 
•	Violation of Oregon laws. 

This means that in Oregon, if a tenant engages in the legal use or cultivation of marijuana – i.e. with a valid card – doing so is not a violation of state law. If a landlord seeks to prevent such activity, the answer must then be found, if at all, in the rental agreement or the rules.  Without an express prohibition contained in one of these documents, it may be difficult to bring an eviction action for legal marijuana use or cultivation – unless the tenant’s conduct violates some other rule or provision in the rental agreement.
